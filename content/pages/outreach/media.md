Is your research using TESS data press-worthy?



Submit a [TESS Media Coverage Request](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/media_req_tess/) for media support consideration. Please consider submitting at the same time you submit a paper for publication, and before submitting it to a prepring server (like arXiv).

A copy of this form will be emailed to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Astrophysics Division Communications Team Leadership: Amber Straughn, Claire Saravia, Frank Reddy, Barb Mattson, and Jeanette Kazmierczak. If a paper is associated with this submission, the submission is not considered complete until you have also sent a current draft of your paper to Claire Saravia.


Thereâ€™s a lot that goes into creating press products based on results: from coordinating and writing the web feature/press release, producing a video, and commissioning animations, if necessary, and even planning a press event, if the result is significant enough.

The team needs an adequate heads up, about one month in most cases, to do this right.
