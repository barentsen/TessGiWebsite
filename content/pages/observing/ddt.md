Title: TESS Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program
Save_as: ddt.html

We anticipate that a small percentage of the available TESS resources in each sector may be allocated as Director's Discretionary Targets (DDTs). The primary utilization of DDT programs is in support of community-proposed requests that are based on exceptional, time-critical observing opportunities that cannot be accommodated with the regular proposal cycle. Other DDT usages include innovative observations that extend the scientific capabilities of TESS, and extraordinary events and opportunities that necessitate observations be obtained with TESS for the benefit of the astronomical community. Note that all DDT observations are publicly available immediately, and no funding is available to the proposer for DDT observations. 

The purpose of the DDT program for TESS is therefore to facilitate observations that address emerging scientific topics or areas missed in the proposal review process and:

* respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae;
* yield high-impact science from TESS;
* enhance existing GI programs with additional critical data.

More details of the DDT program will appear here when the program is launched. In the mean-time please contact [tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov) with comments and concerns.

<!-- ## Proposal Information

A DDT request should consist of <2 pages of text including all
figures, tables, and references, no smaller than 13-point font, and
submitted in .pdf format via email to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
All DDT requests must include:

* a strong scientific justification;
* a description of the long-term legacy value of the program;
* a justification for why the request was not submitted during the previous Call for Proposals;
* a separate target table (does not count toward the 2-page limit; the required format as well as a [template for the target table can be found here]().

Beause e-mail may occasionally get lost, you should expect to receive a notification of receipt after submitting your proposal.

In all DDT submissions, please specify the institution and email address
of the principal investigator and include the campaign for which
targets are being proposed in the subject line of the email (e.g. *K2
C14 DDT proposal*).

Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. Requests for DDT cannot be used to resubmit all or part of a proposal that was rejected by the normal peer review process. DDT proposals from every institution are encouraged.

DDT proposals are reviewed for both technical feasibility by someone in the project office and for scientific value by an outside reviewer.  The results of these reviews are sent to the K2 Project Scientist for approval and, if approved, the targets are placed into the observing list for the upcoming campaign.  An email reply to the proposer, stating the fate of the DDT request, will be sent out by the GO Office approximately one month before the start of the campaign for which targets were proposed.

## Proposal Deadlines

To ensure that approved targets are able to be included in the final
target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted via email
to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov) by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the following dates:

* **February 23, 2017 for Campaign 14**
* **May 25, 2017 for Campaign 15**
* **September 7, 2017 for Campaign 16**

The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 are provided [at the field information page](k2-fields.html).  -->
