Title: TESS Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program
Save_as: ddt.html


The DDT and out-of-cycle Target of Opportunity processes for TESS will draw heavily on those used successfully for the NuStar Explorer mission. Requests and targets will be submitted through a form on the MIT TESS website. The requests will be reviewed by the TESS PI, a science expert selected by the TESS PI, and the TESS operations team. Approved targets will be posted on the MIT TESS website, along with the expected time(s) of observation.  There is no proprietary period for approved DDT observations. Data from a DDT observation will be delivered to the TESS archives concurrently with the non-DDT data from the sector in which the DDT is observed.
 
For Year 1 (Sectors 1-13) of the TESS survey, there will be 20,000 DDT targets allocated for 2 minute data. For the first three observation sectors (Sectors 1-3), there can be up to 1500 DDT targets awarded per sector, depending upon the realized in-flight data compression. 



<!-- ## Proposal Information

A DDT request should consist of <2 pages of text including all
figures, tables, and references, no smaller than 13-point font, and
submitted in .pdf format via email to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
All DDT requests must include:

* a strong scientific justification;
* a description of the long-term legacy value of the program;
* a justification for why the request was not submitted during the previous Call for Proposals;
* a separate target table (does not count toward the 2-page limit; the required format as well as a [template for the target table can be found here]().

Beause e-mail may occasionally get lost, you should expect to receive a notification of receipt after submitting your proposal.

In all DDT submissions, please specify the institution and email address
of the principal investigator and include the campaign for which
targets are being proposed in the subject line of the email (e.g. *K2
C14 DDT proposal*).

Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. Requests for DDT cannot be used to resubmit all or part of a proposal that was rejected by the normal peer review process. DDT proposals from every institution are encouraged.

DDT proposals are reviewed for both technical feasibility by someone in the project office and for scientific value by an outside reviewer.  The results of these reviews are sent to the K2 Project Scientist for approval and, if approved, the targets are placed into the observing list for the upcoming campaign.  An email reply to the proposer, stating the fate of the DDT request, will be sent out by the GO Office approximately one month before the start of the campaign for which targets were proposed.

## Proposal Deadlines

To ensure that approved targets are able to be included in the final
target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted via email
to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov) by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the following dates:

* **February 23, 2017 for Campaign 14**
* **May 25, 2017 for Campaign 15**
* **September 7, 2017 for Campaign 16**

The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 are provided [at the field information page](k2-fields.html).  -->
