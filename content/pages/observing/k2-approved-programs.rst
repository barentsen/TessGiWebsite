This page details the targets and programs that have been executed by K2
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the observed targets.

After data has been released, the 
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ 
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.


Campaign 13
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
    The Campaign 13 target list includes <b>21,434 standard long cadence</b> and <b>109 standard short cadence</b> targets,
    located towards the constellation of Taurus
    in the Galactic Anti-Center direction.
    </p>


    <p>
    Notable targets include:
    <ul>
    <li>
    members of the <b>Taurus star-forming region</b> including two well-known T Tauri-type stars:
    <ul>
    <li>
        <b>HL Tau</b> (EPIC 210690913);
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LkCa 15</b> (EPIC 247520207);
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        the nearby <b>Hyades open cluster</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        the distant clusters <b>NGC 1647</b>, <b>NGC 1746</b> and <b>NGC 1817</b>;
    </li>
    <li>
        33 galaxies;
    </li>
    <li>
        6 Trojan asteroids;
    </li>
    <li>
        8 Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs);
    </li>
    <li>
        1 Comet (246P/NEAT).
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Moreover, a total of <b>33 bright stars</b> (Kp 0-6),
    including <b>Aldebaran</b> and more than 15 members
    of the Hyades,
    are being observed using a custom 40-pixel diameter circular aperture mask.
    Such circular masks capture the PSF cores while excluding
    the long saturation columns which tend to bleed off silicon.
    Nine bright Hyades members are also being observed in short cadence
    using a similar custom mask.
    </p>

Campaign 12
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
    The Campaign 12 target list includes <b>29,221 standard long cadence</b> and <b>141 standard short cadence</b> targets,
    all located in a high-Galactic latitude field (-60&deg;)
    on the boundary between the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces.
    </p>

    <p>
    The short cadence list includes <b>TRAPPIST-1</b>,
    an ultracool dwarf star known to host
    several Earth-sized transiting planets.
    A generous 11-by-11 pixel short cadence mask 
    will be used to capture this target (mask ID 200164267).
    </p>

    <p>
    The long cadence list includes <b>2,576 galaxies</b> to enable
    supernovae and AGN studies.
    It also includes <b>8 bright stars</b> (Kp ~5)
    for which we collect only the central region of pixels 
    using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, long cadence custom masks were scheduled to observe
    <b>19 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>9 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>,
    and <b>4 Comets</b> (90P/Gehrels, 95P/Chiron, 176P/LINEAR, 228P/LINEAR).
    The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled
    using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips.
    Most notably, the well-known <b>Centaur 95P/Chiron</b>
    will be observed for the entire duration of the campaign in long cadence
    (mask ID range 200164175–200164266)
    and for 20 days in short cadence (IDs 200161173–200162430).

Campaign 11
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
    The Campaign 11 target list includes <b>14,209 standard long cadence</b> and <b>65 standard short cadence</b> targets.
    The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field targeted by this Campaign.
    </p>

    <p>
    We gained efficiency by tiling <b>five globular clusters—M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5</b>—which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
    The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular aperture because it fell only partially on silicon.
    </p>

    <p>
    The target list also includes <b>11 very bright stars</b> (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) for which we target only the central region of pixels using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
    Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp; 36 Oph) and
    the others in long cadence.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we will also observe <b>55 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>7 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>, and Saturn's moons <b>Titan and Enceladus</b>.
    The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that this is the first campaign to be executed after the <a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'>loss of CCD Module 4</a>.
    Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
    Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
    and no program lost more than 20%.

  <p>
  The Campaign 10 target list includes 28,345 standard long cadence and 138 short cadence targets. The standard long cadence targets include 4,950 small galaxies, while the short cadence list includes the famous quasar 3C-273. In addition, we have included large pixel masks over 27 large galaxies, 11 Hilda asteroids, 4 TNOs, and comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko which is currently being investigated by the Rosetta mission. Finally, we also observed 8 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.

Campaign 9b
-----------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
  The majority of the Campaign 9 pixel budget was dedicated to
  <a href="k2-c9.html">a study of gravitational microlensing events</a>
  toward the Galactic bulge. The aim of this program was to simultaneously observe gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to see a parallax effect in the shape and time of lensing events. 
  A near-contiguous superstamp of 3.7 deg<sup>2</sup> was observed in long cadence for this purpose, covering large swaths of CCD channels 30, 31, 32, 49, and 52 (program ID GO9001).
  Additional custom masks were allocated to capture isolated PRF reference
  stars (GO9002), dark clouds for noise model inference (GO9003),
  and small masks to cover ongoing microlensing events outside the main superstamp (GO9004). 
  </p>

  <p>
  The experiment included a three-day, mid-campaign break for data downlinking, splitting the campaign into two halves: C9a and C9b.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The remaining part of the pixel budget was made available to the community via the DDT program.  The DDT target list included 1,480 long cadence
  and 12 short cadence masks. Custom targets included 
  Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar and a superstamp to cover
  the core of the Lagoon star-forming region (M8).

  The Campaign 8 target list includes 24187 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. The planet Uranus will be observed for roughly a month in short cadence and the remaining time in long cadence, in addition four of its moons make the long cadence target list. Six Hilda asteroids and four TNOs round out the solar system targets. The irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 will be observed with a large pixel mask and several very bright stars will be targeted using custom pixel masks that only collect the wings of the PSF.

Campaign 7
---------------------
.. raw:: html
  
  <p>
  In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.

  <p>
    The Campaign 3 target list consists of 16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (225088) 2007 OR10, the planet Neptune and its moon Nereid. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the entire extent of (225088) 2007 OR10, Neptune and Nereid in long cadence, and we have tiled approximate 20 days either side of the stationary point of Neptune in short cadence.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was an error in the software we supplied to the community that reports whether potential targets fall on active silicon. The roll coordinate used in the software was 5 degrees off from the as-flown pointing. The result is that roughly 20% of proposed targets fell off active silicon and were not observable. We backfilled the target list with targets from lower ranked programs. The error was regrettable and we have put steps in place to prevent this happening again.

Campaign 2
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 2 target list consists of 13,399 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over the clusters M4 and M80. If a target falls within either the M4 or M80 large mask it will not appear in the target list.
  </p>
  <p>
      Two Solar System bodies were selected - trans-Neptunian object (278361) 2007 JJ43 and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The Solar System bodies are moving relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. The full cluster and Solar System pixel masks are made up of many smaller masks.

Campaign 0
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    Campaign 0 was a full-length engineering test and is notably shorter in
    duration than later campaigns.  This in the only campaign where the target list was not selected
    by peer-review.  The Campaign 0 target list
    includes the open clusters M35 (NGC 2168) and NGC 2158.  These
    were observed using 154 separate 50x50 pixel masks.

Concept Engineering Test
------------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
  Between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, the Kepler spacecraft
  executed a very short engineering test to demonstrate the K2 mission concept
  and its photometric precision.
  The formal name of this data set is the <i>"Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test"</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  During this nine-day test, the spacecraft observed 2,000 long cadence and 17 short cadence target masks towards a test field located near (ra, dec) = (359&deg;, -2&deg;).
  The masks were centered on a variety of targets selected by the Kepler Science Center, including known planet hosts, eclipsing binaries, variables, hot stars, and cool dwarfs.
  All masks were deliberately designed to be very large,
  measuring 50-by-50 pixels each,
  to enable the K2 pointing performance to be assessed.
  Each mask contains multiple stars in addition to the main target as a result.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Kepler/K2 Science Center does not support this engineering data set
  at the same level as official K2 campaigns,
  e.g. light curve products have not been generated.
  However Target Pixel Files have been made available.
  </p>
