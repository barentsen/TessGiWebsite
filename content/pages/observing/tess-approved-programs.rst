This page will detail the targets and programs that will have been executed by TESS
as part of the `Guest Investigator program <tess-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs will be posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens XX months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the observed targets.

After data has been released, the 
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ 
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.


Campaign 12
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
    The Campaign 12 target list includes <b>29,221 standard long cadence</b> and <b>141 standard short cadence</b> targets,
    all located in a high-Galactic latitude field (-60&deg;)
    on the boundary between the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces.
    </p>

    <p>
    The short cadence list includes <b>TRAPPIST-1</b>,
    an ultracool dwarf star known to host
    several Earth-sized transiting planets.
    A generous 11-by-11 pixel short cadence mask 
    will be used to capture this target (mask ID 200164267).
    </p>

    <p>
    The long cadence list includes <b>2,576 galaxies</b> to enable
    supernovae and AGN studies.
    It also includes <b>8 bright stars</b> (Kp ~5)
    for which we collect only the central region of pixels 
    using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, long cadence custom masks were scheduled to observe
    <b>19 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>9 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>,
    and <b>4 Comets</b> (90P/Gehrels, 95P/Chiron, 176P/LINEAR, 228P/LINEAR).
    The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled
    using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips.
    Most notably, the well-known <b>Centaur 95P/Chiron</b>
    will be observed for the entire duration of the campaign in long cadence
    (mask ID range 200164175–200164266)
    and for 20 days in short cadence (IDs 200161173–200162430).
