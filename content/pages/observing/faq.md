Title: TESS Guest Investigator Program Frequently Asked Questions
Save_as: faq.html



#### **How many TESS 2-minute target slots will be available to TESS Guest Investigators?**

About 5% of TESS targets (~25,000) will be available to the GI program during the course of the 2-year baseline mission.

#### **Will funds also be available?**

Yes. TESS Guest Investigators at US Institutions may apply for funding to support their TESS Investigations.

#### **What if I have an interesting and timely TESS target that needs to be observed quickly, once TESS is launched?**

 About 10% of the GI targets will be reserved for rapid turn-around, Director's Discretionary Time (DDT). If your target can't wait for the next GI proposal cycle, then DDT is the route for you.

#### **When will the Call for Proposals be released?**

 About one year prior to launch. The call will come out about 2-3 months prior to the deadline for proposals. A peer review will be held 2-3 months following this deadline, with targets and funds announced soon thereafter. The schedule is driven by the date when GI targets need to be incorporated into the TESS Target Input Catalog (TIC). The Call for Proposals will be an amendment to NASA's Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES).

#### **Will there be any proprietary time period for GI targets?**

 No. All GI data will become immediately public when it arrives in the TESS archive at STScI/MAST.

#### **Are there any restrictions on the types of targets that can be proposed through the TESS GI Program?**

 No. Similar to Kepler and K2, the TESS GI Program will consider all scientifically compelling astrophysical targets, from solar system objects, to transiting exoplanets, to stellar variability, to normal and active galaxies. If you can think of a compelling science justification, and the proposed observations are technically feasible, it will be considered.

#### **What if I can do my science with TESS full frame images, and don't need to propose for targets?**

 These proposals will request funding only, and will be allowed under the TESS GI Program.

#### **How will my TESS GI targets be processed?**

 TESS data processing takes place at the Science Processing Operation Center (SPOC), designed and operated at NASA Ames Research Center. The SPOC is developing the image processing and transit photometry software, leveraging the Kepler Mission's Science Operations Center (SOC) pipeline software. More information on the Kepler software can be found [here](http://kepler.nasa.gov/science/ForScientists/papersAndDocumentation/SOCpapers)

#### **What software tools will be available?**

 Shortly before the call for proposals is released, the GI Program Office will make software available for planning observations. Analysis software will be developed and made available as needs are foreseen and/or arise.

#### **Where can I send my suggestion for an idea I'd like to see incorporated into the TESS GI Program, or a software tool I'd like to suggest be developed?**
