[TOC]

The TESS mission provides the community with an opportunity to make ground-breaking discoveries in the field of exoplanets, astrophysics and planetary science. A
description of the mission concept can be found in
[Ricker et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JATIS...1a4003R) and the [TESS Observatory Guide](link-to-guidebook.something). 

## Overview

The TESS spacecraft hosts a 4 10-cm aperture cameras in an
eccentric high-earth orbit in a 2-to-1 resonance with the Moon. This insures a thermally stable environment, provides the ability to remain on a single pointing for the
duration of each Sector, and allows for high data rates during perigee. 
Pointing is maintained by a combination of two reaction wheels and thrusters, 
reacting to motion data provided by fine guidance sensors 
(fine-point observing) or star trackers (coarse-point observing). 

With only two remaining reaction wheels, 
these operations are only possible while pointing within 
the orbital plane of the spacecraft, which approximates to the ecliptic. 
Only this specific family of pointings yields operational configurations 
where solar pressure is largely mitigated by spacecraft geometry, 
thereby making viable precision pointing and photometry 
approaching the quality achieved for the Kepler mission. 

### Capabilities

Science observations are taken at one of two timing settings: long (30-min) or short (1-min) cadence. When in fine-point observing, [K2 is capable of achieving a benchmark photometric precision](k2-observing.html#fine-point-photometric-precision) on an m<sub>V</sub> = 12 G2V star of better than 170 parts-per-million (ppm) in 30 minutes of integration, i.e., one long cadence exposure. 
This corresponds to ~30 ppm over a 6.5-hour transit 
of an Earth-sized body around that star.

While stars brighter than m<sub>V</sub> = 11.5 will saturate some pixels, 
K2 performs well on stars as bright as m<sub>V</sub> = 4, 
provided the scientific benefit justifies the large number of pixels 
needed to capture saturated flux bleeding along CCD columns. 
Kepler also has many faint-target scientific applications 
where m<sub>V</sub> = 20 objects yield a photometric precision 
of 10% over 30 minutes.

The broad photometric bandpass has a half-maximum transmission range 
of 430 to 840 nm. 
The instrument has neither changeable filters, 
dispersing elements, nor a shutter. 
The detector has a pixel scale of 3.98 arcseconds. 
Image quality varies with position in the focal plane, 
with the 95% encircled energy diameter ranging from 3.1 to 7.5 pixels with a median value of 4.2 pixels. 
The percentage of point-source flux concentrated in the center pixel 
is between 20% and 62% with a median value of 45%.
