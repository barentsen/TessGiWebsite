## Publication database

The TESS Science Support Center curates a list of scientific publications
pertaining to TESS.
The database contains 49 publications,
of which 28 are peer-reviewed.
It demonstrates the important impact of TESS data
on astronomical research.

You can access the full publication list:

Or seach by topic:

 * [Exoplanet publications >>](tpub-exoplanets.html)
 * [Astrophysics publications >>](tpub-astrophysics.html)

If you spot an error in the database, such as a missing entry,
please get in touch or open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/tessgi/tpub">GitHub repository</a> of the database.
