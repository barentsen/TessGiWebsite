## Publication database

The Guest Investigator office curates a list of scientific publications
pertaining to TESS.
The database contains 32 publications,
of which 22 are peer-reviewed.
It demonstrates the important impact of TESS data
on astronomical research.

You can access the full publication list:

Or seach by topic:

 * <a href="tpub-exoplanets.html">Exoplanet publications &raquo;</a>
 * <a href="tpub-astrophysics.html">Astrophysics publications &raquo;</a>

If you spot an error in the database, such as a missing entry,
please get in touch or open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/tessgi/tpub">GitHub repository</a> of the database.
