## TESS Observatory

The TESS observatory consists of a payload and spacecraft. The payload is comprised of four identical wide field-of-view CCD cameras and their associated hoods, mount, sun shield and a Data Handling Unit (DHU). The payload is coupled to the spacecraft, an Orbital Sciences LEOStar-2/750 satellite bus. The spacecraft provides power (via two deployable solar arrays), attitude control, data storage, and communications/transmission. 

## TESS Cameras
TESS is equipped with four refractive cameras, each with a 2000x2000 pixel CCD that provides a 24x24 degree field-of-view. The combined field-of-view yields a 24x96 degree observing sector. Each camera will collect 2 second exposures which will be stacked at 2 minute cadence for ~200k pre-selected targets (or 'postage stamps') and transmitted back to Earth. Full Frame Images, which consist of all pixels observed for a given camera, will be collected at 30 minute cadence.
