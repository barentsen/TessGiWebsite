[TOC]

The TESS observatory consists of the spacecraft and the instrument. The TESS observatory has a single instrument, a camera suite composed of 4 wide field optical cameras and their associated hoods, mount, sun shield, and Data Handling Unit (ADHU). The spacecraft refers to the subset of the observatory that does not include the Instrument. It consists of the Mechanical, Electrical Power, Command & Data Handling, RF Communications, Attitude Control, Flight Software, Hydrazine Propulsion, Thermal Control, and Harness Subsystems. The spacecraft provides power via two deployable solar arrays.

## TESS cameras

TESS is equipped with four identical refractive cameras, each with a 2000x2000 pixel CCD that provides a 24x24 degree field-of-view (FOV). The combined FOV from all four cameras yields a 24x96 degree observing sector. Each camera consists of a CCD detector assembly, a lens assembly, and a lens hood. An overview of the FOV coverage and observing strategy for the mission can be found in the [Operations](operations.html) page.

### Bandpass
TESS will observe a large number of M dwarfs for several reasons. Planets are easier to detect around these small stars (the planets induce larger transit signals). Most nearby stars are M dwarfs. Because M dwarfs are cool and red, the TESS bandpass will be more sensitive to red wavelengths. These considerations led to the choice of a 600 to 1000 nm bandpass. The width of 400 nm was the largest practical choice for the optical design.

## Spacecraft

The spacecraft is being built by Orbital ATK in Dulles, VA, where the Mission Operations Center (MOC) is located. The MOC will provide overall command and control of the TESS spacecraft during the mission.
