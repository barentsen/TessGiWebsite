[TOC]

The TESS observatory consists of a payload and spacecraft. The payload is comprised of four identical wide field-of-view CCD cameras and their associated hoods, mount, sun shield and a Data Handling Unit (DHU). The payload is coupled to the spacecraft, an Orbital Sciences LEOStar-2/750 satellite bus. The spacecraft provides power (via two deployable solar arrays), attitude control, data storage, and communications/transmission. 

## TESS Cameras

TESS is equipped with four refractive cameras, each with a 2000x2000 pixel CCD that provides a 24x24 degree field-of-view. The combined field-of-view from all four cameras yields a 24x96 degree observing sector.

### Bandpass

[Enhanced sensitivity to red wavelengths is desired because small planets are more easily detected around small stars, which are cool and red.
These considerations led to the choice of a 600 to 1000 nm bandpass. The red end represents the red limit of silicon CCD sensitivity, and the width of 400 nm was the largest practical choice for the optical design. This bandpass is centered on the traditional IC band but is much wider (see Fig. 1). It is com- parable to the union of the RC, IC, and z bands.]

Also plotted, for comparison, are the Johnsonâ€“Cousins V, R C , and I C filter curves and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey z filter curve. Each of the functions has been scaled to have a maximum value of unity. Image Credit: Ricker et al. (2015)*
