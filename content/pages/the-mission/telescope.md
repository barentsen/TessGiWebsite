### TESS Observatory

The TESS observatory consists of a payload and spacecraft. The payload is comprised of four identical wide field-of-view CCD cameras and their associated hoods, mount, and sun shield and a Data Handling Unit (DHU). The payload is coupled to the spacecraft, an Orbital Sciences LEOStar-2/750 satellite bus. The spacecraft provides power (via two deployable solar arrays), attitude control, data storage, and communications/transmission.
