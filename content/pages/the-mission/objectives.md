## TESS
**Discovering New Earths and Super-Earths in the Solar Neighborhood**

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is an Explorer-class planet finder. In the first-ever spaceborne all-sky transit survey, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized to gas giants, orbiting a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances. The principal goal of the TESS mission is to detect small planets with bright host stars in the solar neighborhood, so that detailed characterizations of the planets and their atmospheres can be performed.

TESS will monitor the brightnesses of more than 200,000 stars during a two year mission, searching for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Transits occur when a planet's orbit carries it directly in front of its parent star as viewed from Earth. TESS is expected to catalog more than 1,500 transiting exoplanet candidates, including a sample of ∼500 Earth-sized and ‘Super Earth’ planets, with radii less than twice that of the Earth. TESS will detect small rock-and-ice planets orbiting a diverse range of stellar types and covering a wide span of orbital periods, including rocky worlds in the habitable zones of their host stars.

As a primary goal, TESS will provide a yield of 50 planets around FGKM stars with radii less than 4 times the Earth's radius that will have masses measured through follow-up ground-based facilities. This yield will provide potential targets for NASA's future missions like the James Webb Space Telescope, which will have the capability to probe the atmospheres of planets.

**Guest Investigator Program**

The TESS Mission will have a robust [Guest Investigator Program](tess-proposing-targets.html) that will be managed by the TESS Community Science Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. TESS targets will be proposed by the community for research that spans a wide range of astrophysics.

The TESS mission welcomes all proposals including, but not exclusive to, exoplanet, stellar, extragalactic, and solar system science. The following is a list of potential targets:

<ul>
<li>Possible transiting planet hosts</li>
<li>Known exoplanet hosts</li>
<li>Pulsating stars</li>
<li>Rotationally variable stars</li>
<li>Flaring stars</li>
<li>Accreting stars and interacting binaries</li>
<li>Binary stars</li>
<li>Open clusters</li>
<li>Stellar associations</li>
<li>Galaxies and supernovae</li>
<li>Active galactic nuclei</li>
<li>Microlenses</li>
<li>Solar System planets</li>
<li>Asteroids</li>
<li>Comets</li>
</ul>
