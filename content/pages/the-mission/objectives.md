## TESS Overview
**Discovering New Earths and Super-Earths in the Solar Neighborhood**

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is an Explorer-class planet finder. In the first-ever spaceborne all-sky transit survey, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized to gas giants, orbiting a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances. TESS stars will be 30-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the Kepler satellite. Planets detected around these stars will therefore be far easier to characterize with follow-up observations, resulting in refined measurements of the planet masses, sizes, densities, and atmospheric properties.

TESS will monitor the brightnesses of more than 200,000 stars during a two year mission, searching for temporary drops in brightness caused by a planet crossing in front of its parent star as viewed from Earth. As a primary goal, TESS will provide a yield of 50 planets around FGKM stars with radii less than 4 times the Earth's radius that will have masses measured through follow-up ground-based facilities. TESS is also expected to catalog more than 1,500 transiting exoplanet candidates, including a sample of ∼500 Earth-sized and ‘Super Earth’ planets, with radii less than twice that of the Earth. 

TESS will provide prime targets for further, more detailed characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future. TESS's legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting exoplanets, which will comprise the most favorable targets for detailed investigations in the coming decades.


## TESS Guest Investigator Program

The TESS Mission will have a robust [Guest Investigator Program](tess-proposing-targets.html) that will be managed by the TESS Community Science Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Under the GI program, the astrophysics community may propose new 2 min cadence targets (~10,000 per cycle) and investigations using the 30 min cadence FFI data. TESS GI calls will occur once per year and be announced within the NASA ROSES solicitation.  

The TESS mission welcomes all proposals including, but not exclusive to, exoplanet, stellar, extragalactic, and solar system science. The following is a list of potential targets:

<ul>
<li>Possible transiting planet hosts</li>
<li>Known exoplanet hosts</li>
