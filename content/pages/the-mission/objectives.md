## TESS
**Discovering New Earths and Super-Earths in the Solar Neighborhood**

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is an Explorer-class planet finder. In the first-ever spaceborne all-sky transit survey, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized to gas giants, orbiting a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances. The principal goal of the TESS mission is to detect small planets with bright host stars in the solar neighborhood, so that detailed characterizations of the planets and their atmospheres can be performed.

TESS will monitor the brightnesses of more than 200,000 stars during a two year mission, searching for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Transits occur when a planet's orbit carries it directly in front of its parent star as viewed from Earth. TESS is expected to catalog more than 1,500 transiting exoplanet candidates, including a sample of ∼500 Earth-sized and ‘Super Earth’ planets, with radii less than twice that of the Earth. TESS will detect small rock-and-ice planets orbiting a diverse range of stellar types and covering a wide span of orbital periods, including rocky worlds in the habitable zones of their host stars.

## K2
**Extending Kepler's power to the ecliptic**

The loss of a second of the four reaction wheels on board the Kepler 
spacecraft in May 2013 brought an end to Kepler's four plus year science 
mission to continuously monitor more than 150,000 stars to search for
transiting exoplanets.  Developed over the months following this failure, 
the [K2 mission](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..398H) represents a new concept for spacecraft operations 
that enables continued scientific observations 
with the Kepler space telescope. K2 became fully operational in June
2014 and is expected to continue operating until 2017 or 2018.

The K2 mission entails a series of sequential observing
<a href="k2-fields.html">"Campaigns"</a> 
of fields distributed around the ecliptic plane 
and offers a photometric precision <a
href="k2-observing.html#fine-point-photometric-precision">approaching that 
of the original Kepler mission</a>. Operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted 
on the spacecraft by solar wind pressure, 
reducing pointing drift to the point where spacecraft attitude 
can effectively be controlled through a combination of thrusters 
and the two remaining reaction wheels. Each campaign is therefore limited by Sun angle constraints 
to a duration of approximately 80 days. 

**Scientific motivations**

K2 is an entirely community-driven mission.
All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the
[Guest Observer program](k2-proposing-targets.html).  The scientific potential spans a wide range of astrophysics.
It is anticipated that K2 will:

* Provide a yield of **hot planets around bright stars** for follow-up transit 
spectroscopy to facilitate rapid advances in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.
* Provide a yield of **small planets around bright, small stars** to facilitate the most precise follow-up measurements to date
of masses, densities and compositions.
* Identify locations and characteristics of **potentially-habitable planets
around bright M-dwarfs** in the solar neighborhood.
* Determine if **hot gas giants exist around young stars**,
or whether they migrate to small orbits at a later epoch
by tidal or other interactions.
* Determine the relationship between **stellar structure, rotation and activity** 
within stellar associations over a range of ages and metallicity.
* Identify the progenitors of **Type Ia supernovae**
from photometric structure in the rise to outburst maximum.
* Discover and characterize **binary stars** within open clusters and stellar associations.
* Characterize internal stellar structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of **asteroseismology**.
* Provide a large, regular cadence survey of **AGN activity** 
in the optical bandpass.
* Participate in multi-mission, **multi-band monitoring campaigns**
of ecliptic targets along with other space-based hardware or ground-based telescopes.
