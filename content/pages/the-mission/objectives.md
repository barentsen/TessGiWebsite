## TESS
**Discovering New Earths and Super-Earths in the Solar Neighborhood**

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is an Explorer-class planet finder. In the first-ever spaceborne all-sky transit survey, TESS will identify planets ranging from Earth-sized to gas giants, orbiting a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances. The principal goal of the TESS mission is to detect small planets with bright host stars in the solar neighborhood, so that detailed characterizations of the planets and their atmospheres can be performed.

TESS will monitor the brightnesses of more than 200,000 stars during a two year mission, searching for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Transits occur when a planet's orbit carries it directly in front of its parent star as viewed from Earth. TESS is expected to catalog more than 1,500 transiting exoplanet candidates, including a sample of ∼500 Earth-sized and ‘Super Earth’ planets, with radii less than twice that of the Earth. TESS will detect small rock-and-ice planets orbiting a diverse range of stellar types and covering a wide span of orbital periods, including rocky worlds in the habitable zones of their host stars.

**Scientific motivations**

A select set of TESS targets will be proposed by the community through the
[Guest Observer program](tess-proposing-targets.html).  The scientific potential spans a wide range of astrophysics.
It is anticipated that TESS will:

* Provide a yield of **hot planets around bright stars** for follow-up transit 
spectroscopy to facilitate rapid advances in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.
* Provide a yield of **small planets around bright, small stars** to facilitate the most precise follow-up measurements to date
of masses, densities and compositions.
* Identify locations and characteristics of **potentially-habitable planets
around bright M-dwarfs** in the solar neighborhood.
* Determine if **hot gas giants exist around young stars**,
or whether they migrate to small orbits at a later epoch
by tidal or other interactions.
* Determine the relationship between **stellar structure, rotation and activity** 
within stellar associations over a range of ages and metallicity.
* Identify the progenitors of **Type Ia supernovae**
from photometric structure in the rise to outburst maximum.
* Discover and characterize **binary stars** within open clusters and stellar associations.
* Characterize internal stellar structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of **asteroseismology**.
* Provide a large, regular cadence survey of **AGN activity** 
in the optical bandpass.
* Participate in multi-mission, **multi-band monitoring campaigns**
of ecliptic targets along with other space-based hardware or ground-based telescopes.
