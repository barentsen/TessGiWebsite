## Overview
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a NASA Astrophysics Explorer mission designed to perform an all-sky survey to detect transiting planets around the closest brightest stars. TESS  is scheduled for launch via a SpaceX Falcon 9 no earlier than March 20, 2018 and will be placed in a highly-elliptical 13.7 day orbit around the Earth.  In its 2-year mission, TESS will monitor ~200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with four wide-field optical CCD cameras to detect periodic drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Photometry of these pre-selected targets will be recorded every 2 min. TESS will also obtain full-frame images (FFIs) of the entire, four camera field-of-view (24o x 96o) at a cadence of 30 min to facilitate additional science.

### Field of view

TESS will tile the sky with 26 observation sectors that will cover over 90% of the sky.

At least 27 days staring at each 24° × 96° sector

Brightest 200,000 stars at 1-minute cadence

Full frame images with 30-minute cadence

Sectors overlap at ecliptic poles for sensitivity to smaller and longer period planets in JWST Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ)

### TESS Mission orbit

TESS observes from unique High Earth Orbit (HEO):

Unobstructed view for continuous light curves

Two 13.7 day orbits per observation sector

Stable 2:1 resonance with Moon's orbit

Thermally stable and low-radiation
