## TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) 
Once the 2 min cadence data are processed and transits are identified, stars hosting high priority planet candidates will be characterized with ground-based imaging and spectroscopy. These observations are used to establish reliable stellar parameters, confirm the existence of planets, refine their radii, and measure planet masses. The focus will be on stars hosting planet candidates <4 Earth radii to measure their masses via radial velocity (RV) follow-up in support of the missionâ€™s primary science requirements. The TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) organizes and carries out follow-up of TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). The TFOP is organized into five sub-groups: Seeing Limited Photometry, Recon Spectroscopy, High-Resolution Imaging, Precise Radial Velocities, and Space Photometry.

TFOP observations will be performed with committed time on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network and the MEarth observatory and numerous other facilities through the usual telescope time allocation processes. The TFOP and TESS science team includes a large group of collaborators and welcomes additional participation and follow-up programs. 

## Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program (ExoFOP)
TFOP organizational information will be publicly available at the [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/), hosted and maintained by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI).
