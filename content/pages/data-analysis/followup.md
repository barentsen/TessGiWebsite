## TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) 
The TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) organizes and carries out follow-up of TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). Once the 2 min cadence data are processed and transits are identified, stars hosting high priority planet candidates will be characterized with ground-based imaging and spectroscopy. These observations are used to establish reliable stellar parameters, confirm the existence of planets, refine their radii, and measure planet masses. The focus will be on stars hosting planet candidates <4 Earth radii to measure their masses via radial velocity (RV) follow-up in support of the missionâ€™s primary science requirements. 

The TFOP is organized into five sub-groups: Seeing Limited Photometry, Recon Spectroscopy, High-Resolution Imaging, Precise Radial Velocities, and Space Photometry. TFOP observations will be performed with committed time on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network and the MEarth observatory and numerous other facilities through the usual telescope time allocation processes. The TFOP and TESS science team includes a large group of collaborators and welcomes additional participation and follow-up programs. 

## Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program (ExoFOP) for TESS
ExoFOP is a web-based service developed and operated by the [NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)](http://nexsci.caltech.edu) originally for the Kepler and K2 Follow-Up Observation Programs. ExoFOP is a 'sand-box' for the community to share data and information regarding follow-up observations to help facilitate the efficient and effective use of community telescope resources. ExoFOP is connected to and integrated with the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu).

ExoFOP will host a dedicated page for the TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP) with a format similar to the Kepler/K2 pages that include:

Summaries of TESS-observed targets
Overview of individual targets
Summary of observations
Observing notes
Links to outside services (Exoplanet Archive tools, MAST data and documentation, Simbad and other host star resources, community-produced light curves and products, etc.)
Telescope resource calendar

All files (data/image/notes) can be uploaded in any format, in single or bulk-uploads. Attached notes can be html to enable linking within ExoFOP or outside. ExoFOP-TESS products will be searchable, and available to sort and download. A tool to follow specific targets, or sets of targets, can be enabled via My Targets with an option for email updates.
