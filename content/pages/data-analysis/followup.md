### Planet Hunters

The [Planet Hunters](http://www.planethunters.org/) website offers the community the opportunity to
visually inspect light curves from Kepler and K2.  Through the
website, users can help identify
new transiting planets, eclipsing binaries, and other types of
variable stars and transient phenomena. Thanks to the participation of hundreds of thousands
of volunteers, Planet Hunters has discovered a number of new planets
in the Kepler data to date.

### CFOP and ExoFOP-K2

The [Kepler Community Follow-up Observing Program (CFOP)](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/home/) website
facilitates collaboration in follow-up studies of planet
candidates discovered by Kepler (KOIs).  CFOP contains up to date information
about the stellar and planetary parameters for each KOI as well as
links to a variety of analysis tools.  Users from the community can
also upload their own follow-up data and/or analysis to aid the
discovery and characterization of Kepler planets.

The
[Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program for K2 (ExoFOP-K2)](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/)
website is similar to the CFOP, but instead facilitiates follow-up
studies of planet candidates discovered by K2.

Both the CFOP and ExoFOP-K2 are funded by NASA through NExScI.

### UBV Photometric Survey

The Howell-Everett Kepler Field UBV Survey provided photometry of the
Kepler field in the
Johnson/Harris U, B, and V filters.  The
photometry was acquired with the NOAO Mosaic1.1 Camera on the
WIYN 0.9m Telescope on Kitt Peak.  Additional information about the
survey and the link to download the data can be found [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kplrubv/).

### Kepler INT Survey

The Kepler Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Survey provided photometry of the Kepler field in the Sloan *ugri* filters as
well as in *H-alpha*.  The photometry was obtained with the [Isaac Newton
Telescope](http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/telescopes/int/) on La Palma.  Additional information about the survey can be found [here](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/research/kis/).

### Kepler/GALEX

In 2013 MAST staff produced a [Kepler/GALEX cross match catalog](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/catalogs.html) and
[search interface](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kgmatch/search.php).
This catalog allows for comparisons between the optical and
ultraviolet fluxes measured by Kepler and GALEX.

### Kepler/UKIRT

The United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) data archive in Edinburgh provides positions and magnitudes
for *J*-band sources within the Kepler field. Archive tools generate
high resolution cut-out images on the fly and allow source cross
matches around user-specified lists of coordinates. The UKIRT dataset
covers 99.5% of the field and was observed and supplied by Phil Lucas
(p.w.lucas at herts.ac.uk). The images have a typical spatial
resolution of 0.8-0.9 arcsec. They are therefore useful for separating
blended stellar pairs and spatially resolving external galaxies.

As an example, the top image below shows the UKIRT *J*-band image of KOI-326
([KIC 9880467](http://archive.stsci.edu//kepler/data_search/search.php?action=Search&ktc_kepler_id=9880467)). The
bottom image is the same field obtained from the DSS2-Red database
through NASA's
[Skyview](http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/titlepage.pl)
facility.

**Instructions for accessing the UKIRT J-band survey of the
Kepler field**

Note that UKIRT cut-outs around each Kepler planet candidate (KOI) are available
on the [CFOP website](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/home/), but you are also
able to download the UKIRT survey images by following these steps:

* The public database with all the UKIRT Kepler field data is available at the [WFCAM Science Archive](http://wsa.roe.ac.uk//login.html).
* Enter the following public login credentials:


	* *username*: **WSERV4**
   	* *password*: **public**
	* *community*: **nonSurvey**
	
	
* The database is called WSERV4v20101019.
* Cut-out images around objects of interest can be obtained using the MultiGetImage tool.
* Coordinates listings for sources near objects of interest can be obtained using the Cross-ID tool. Typical depth is J=19.6 (Vega system).
* The SQL source catalogue is "wserv4Source". This can be interrogated by typing an SQL query into the FreeFormSQL form, e.g. *select ra,dec,japermag3 from wserv4Source where dec between 39.0 and 39.1*
* The list of table columns is available under the Schema Browser. Look under Schema Browser/WSA Non-Survey/10/WSERV4v20101019/wserv4Source.

### K2/UKIRT

The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer and Project Offices are currently running
two UKIRT programs, one to collect high spatial resolution images of
the K2 fields in the *K*-band with the wide-field camera (WFCam) and one to acquire *K*-band
spectra of K2 targets of interest with UIST.

The K2/UKIRT program follows the footsteps of the Kepler/UKIRT
program, with the goal of improving upon the 4 arcsec pixel scale of the Kepler
spacecraft to aid the community in vetting transiting exoplanet
candidates, cluster science, and extragalactic science.  The primary goal of the spectroscopic program
is to provide a uniform catalog of spectra of cool exoplanet candidate
hosts (e.g. M dwarfs) discovered by K2.

All UKIRT observations of K2 fields/targets will be made publicly available to the community on the [ExoFOP website for K2](https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/).
