## Data analysis

MAST will be providing open-source, Python software that will allow users to create custom cutouts of TESS Full-Frame Images given a
coordinate and area on the sky.  The software will provide cutouts of each 30-minute FFI in target pixel file (TPF) FITS format.  There are plans to offer additional functionality, such as quick-look light curves from the cutouts, and source catalogs that can be overlaid on the returned files.
