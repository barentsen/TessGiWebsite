[TOC]

The *official* archive for TESS mission data products is the
[Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess)
which is hosted at the
[Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](http://www.stsci.edu/). 

In the following sections we list the main products from TESS, and we describe a few of the products in some detail.  For tools
and tips on
inspecting and analyzing TESS data, [users should check out this page](software.html).

We encourage users of TESS data to read through the
[documentation associated with the TESS data products](documentation.html). The first port of call for the TESS user is the [TESS Observatory Handbook](link!!).

## Main data products

A variety of data products from TESS will be archived at MAST for guest investigators. 

### Full frame images (FFIs)
A Full Frame Image (FFI) is a collection of science and collateral pixels observed simultaneously.  A single FFI is the full set of all science and collateral pixels across all CCDs of a given camera.  FFIs will be taken every 30 minutes during science operations, and there will be 1296 FFIs per data set. Each calibrated FFI will be exported as a FITs file. The Cosmic Ray Mitigated (CRM) FFIs are the same as FFIs except they will be collected with the onboard cosmic ray mitigation enabled. 

There are 16 CCDs on the spacecraft, each of which is supported by 4 output channels; each output channel digitizes science pixels over 2048 rows x 512 columns, plus appropriate collateral pixels.

### Target pixel files (TPFs)
The target pixel files are the rawest form of target-specific data that will be available at MAST. For each 2 minute cadence target, TESS only acquires the pixels contained within a predefined mask. These pixels are used to create the data found in the light curve files. Each target pixel file packages these pixels as a time series of images in a binary FITS table. The intent of these files is to provide the data necessary to perform photometry on the raw or calibrated data when needed (or desired) to understand (or improve) the automated results of the TESS pipeline.
In the binary table, the pixel values are encoded as images. Each element in the binary table contains the pixels from a single cadence.

### Light curve files
Light curve files contain flux time series data and are produced for each target using simple aperture photometry. The flux and uncertainties are provided at each cadence, with NaNs filling in any missing data values. The light curves are packaged as FITS binary table files and are used to search for transiting planets and other astrophysical phenomena.

### Collateral data

Collateral data includes pixels from leading and trailing virtual columns, leading and trailing masked rows, and trailing virtual rows (in units of ADC counts). Additional collateral data includes auxiliary instrument models which describe the calibration effects. Pixel calibration is performed on both the cadence pixels and Full Frame Image (FFI) pixels, and calibrated science pixel values, in photoelectrons, along with their uncertainties are archived at the MAST. 

## Auxiliary data products
Auxiliary data consists of focal plane characterization files, engineering and telemetry data used to calibrate the images and determine the status of the spacecraft.

*Black level*: the mean correction estimated from the virtual black pixel values. There is one metric value per cadence for each CCD readout. 

*Smear*: the correction for shutterless operation. The smear will be less critical for TESS than was needed for Kepler due to the use of frame-transfer in TESS. 

*Gain model*: The linear approximation to the CCD digitizer performance, in units of photoelectrons per digitizer count. Each TESS CCD has its own gain model. Each CCDâ€™s gain model contains separate values for each of the 4 readouts on the CCD.

*Flat field*: A model which describes the pixel-to-pixel variation in response to photons. This allows the variations in individual pixel response to be removed in calibration. The flat field model is 2048 x 2048 for each of 16 CCDs.

*Linearity*: A model which describes the deviations from linearity of the CCD digitizers. Each CCD has its own linearity model with separate values for each of the 4 readouts on the CCD.
 The linearity model is used in conjunction with the gain model of each CCD to convert from a measured number of counts to a flux in photoelectrons.

*Read noise*: an estimate of the variation in pixel values which is caused by the digitization process itself. This is separate from the noise due to Poisson variation in the number of photons collected from a target (known as "shot noise"). The read noise model is used in the calibration process to estimate the uncertainty in pixel values, which is incorporated into the uncertainty propagation process. Each CCD has its own read noise model with separate values for each of the 4 readouts on the CCD.

*2-d black model*: the expected readout of a given CCD, in counts, which is observed when no light is incident upon the detector. The 2-d black model is subtracted from the raw pixel values as part of the calibration process. The 2-d black model also incorporates the expected black values of collateral pixels. Each CCD has a separate 2-d black model. The size of the 2-d black model is 2078 x 2136 for each of 16 CCDs.

*Dark current*: the mean dark current calculated from the virtual row pixel values. There is one metric value per cadence for each readout.

### Cotrending basis vectors (CBVs)
Co-trending basis vectors (CBVs) represent the set of systematic trends present in the ensemble flux data. CBVs will be provided for each operational sector of the mission. These are derived by the TESS pipeline from a Principle Component Analysis and used to mitigate systematic artifacts within the the target light curves. If TESS users see residual systematic problems within their light curve data, the CBVs can be employed in performing a manual photometric correction, more tailored towards the user's science. 

### Point Spread Functions (PSFs)


### Simulated Data
During development of space mission, the ground-segment goes through several tests known as Ground System Interface Test (GSIT). To aid potential TESS users in the development of tools and to assess the feasibility of investigations, the mission is planning to make available data from the GSIT-2 test. This will be available from the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess). The anticipated date for this being made available is late-June.
