## TESS Obseratory Guide
A number of documents have been created to describe the TESS mission. We recommend that users start with the [TESS Observatory Guide](). This guide serves two purposes. The first is to provide a comprehensive description of the TESS observatory design, operations, and capabilities. The second is to provide potential Guest Investigator (GI) proposers detailed information regarding the TESS GI program. This includes descriptions of GI program procedures, services, and tools. 


## TESS project papers

A description of the TESS observatory and science mission: [Ricker et al., 2015, JATIS, 1, 014003](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JATIS...1a4003R)
 
TESS science yield predictions: [Sullivan et al., 2015, ApJ, 809, 77](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...809...77S) and [erratum](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837...99S)
 
TESS Input Catalog and Candidate Target List description: [Stassun et al., 2017, eprint arXiv:1706.00495](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170600495S)

## Data processing pipeline

Users of TESS are encouraged to review the following papers to understand the processing of TESS data before it is archived at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).

 
[The TESS Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SPIE.9913E..3EJ) at NASA Ames Research Center is developing a TESS data processing pipeline. The SPOC will generate calibrated pixels and light curves and will, search for periodic transit events, and generate validation products for the transit-like features in the light curves. All TESS SPOC data products will be archived to the MAST.


The SPOC pipeline is leveraged from the [Kepler Science Processing Pipeline](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..87J)
