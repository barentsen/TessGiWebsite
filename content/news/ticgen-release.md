We are pleased to announce the release of a software tool known as [ticgen](proposal-tools.html#ticgen) that an be used to calculate TESS magnitudes from various different bandpasses, and also calculates the TESS noise level for different brightness sources. The software is a command line tool and can be downloaded from our [Github site](https://github.com/tessgi/ticgen), where we also provide more information. Both ticgen and our other software [tvguide](proposal-tools.html#tvguide) can be used to aid users in writing proposals. 

Additionally, we will soon be released a Web tool that combines the functionality of ticgen and [tvguide](https://github.com/tessgi/tvguide).
