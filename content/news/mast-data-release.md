In order to better inform the community of the arrival times of the
TESS data into the archive, the MAST has changed how and when it will
announce the arrival of new TESS data.  A few days before the data
ingest begins, the date will be placed on the
[TESS Holdings page at MAST](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service),
and MAST will make an announcement on social media (@MAST_News on
twitter).  After ingest begins, one sector of TESS data takes
approximately 20 hours to archive and make available in the MAST
Portal.  Since data files become available immediately after being
archived, during this ingest process the data gradually appear in the
MAST portal and astroquery searches.  After all data are archived,
MAST services such as the bulk downloads, TESScut, and exo.MAST take
another 1-2 days to bring online.  For more information about ingest
and which services are available for each sector, see the
[TESS Holdings at MAST page](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service).

Finally, we note that users can also "watch" the MAST page to receive updates on the archive holdings by following the instructions given on the MAST site.
