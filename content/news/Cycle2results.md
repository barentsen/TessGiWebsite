The selection of TESS Guest Investigator Program Cycle 2 proposals has been finalized. A [full list of selected programs](approved-programs.html) is now available. The over-subscription factor for Cycle 2 was slightly higher than in Cycle 1, so that many highly rated programs were not able to be selected for funding. However, even though a particular program may not have been selected for funding there is still a good chance that it will be either partially for full executed. 

Target lists for each sector are posted around the time a sector begins. We anticipate posting the target list for Sector 14 within the next few weeks, prior to the start of Sector 14 on July 18. We encourage TESS users to keep an eye on the [approved programs](approved-programs.html) page to check if targets in a specific program are being observed.
