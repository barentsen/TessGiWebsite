We are delighted to announce the release of the [Web TESS Target Tool](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtm.py). The tool enables potential TESS users to:
* determine whether their targets are observable in TESS Cycle 1
* estimate the noise level on their targets
* calculate a brightness of their targets in the TESS bandpass

The functionality of this tool is also available via command line tools [ticgen](proposal-tools.html#ticgen) and [tvguide](proposal-tools.html#tvguide).

For comments and questions about this and any other aspects of the Cycle 1 call for proposals, contact us at [tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov).
