The TESS team are exploring options for making TESS full-frame image (FFI) data available more rapidly. To help us plan these activities we would greatly appreciate anyone interested in TESS FFI data to [fill out this short survey](https://forms.gle/wS5UqUuL7U4TWoiV7). Our intention is to understand the value of making FFI data available earlier, and whether MAST services and documentation are required at the same time as data is released.
