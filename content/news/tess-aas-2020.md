The TESS team will be at AAS in January 2020! If you are also attending, and you plan to present TESS results that you think would be of broad interest to the public, [please submit a media request](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/media.html). We would love to showcase as many TESS results as possible, but we need time to prepare stories and graphics. Therefore, we ask that if you are interested in having your work promoted, you submit a media request as soon as possible.
