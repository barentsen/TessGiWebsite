We are delighted that TESS was successfully delivered into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. TESS launched April 18 at 6:51 p.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, roughly 40 minutes later TESS separated from the second stage. Shortly after, solar arrays were deployed and telemetry indicated this occurred flawlessly.

TESS will now undergo a 60 day commissioning plan before beginning the science program.
