TESS Cycle 3 Guest Investigator (GI) proposals are due January 16, 2020. The in-person peer review is expected to take place in mid-March 2020. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in all areas of astrophysics to serve on our review panel. Topics we are particularly interested in recruiting reviewers for are exoplanet science, asteroseismology, stellar activity, binary stars, and supernova observations. The requirements are that (1) you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to graduate students), and (2) you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 3 proposal. If you are undecided about submitting a proposal as PI, you are still welcome to volunteer as a reviewer (it's fine if you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). 

If you're interested in serving as a reviewer, you can submit your name, institution, and areas of expertise via [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/p4ZqiTQSEHjbM6nz2).
