The allocation of targets assigned to the Guest Investigator Program in Cycle 1 has been increased from 10,000 to 20,000 targets. Targets will be approximately evenly split over each of the 13 sectors, leading to around 1,500 targets per sector.

The primary aim of this increase is to increase the flexibility that large programs have in their target selection. With this increase in mind, we encourage wide-ranging investigations to consider how they might utilize this increase in available resources.
