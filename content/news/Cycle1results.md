The selection of TESS Guest Investigator Program Cycle 1 proposals has been finalized. A [full list of selected programs](approved-programs.html) is available. TESS is scheduled to launch by the end of March. If this schedule holds, science operation will begin at the start of June, with the first data reaching [the archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/tess) at the beginning of December. Grants will be released when data is publicly available.

The over-subscription factor for this program was extremely high (4.5). Many highly rated programs were not able to be selected for funding. However, we have good news. All full-frame-image data will be released publicly with no exclusive use period.

Furthermore, we anticipate that the number of executed 2-minute cadence target programs will significantly exceed the number that we were able to fund. Therefore, even though a particular program may not have been selected for funding there is still a good chance that it will be either partially for full executed.

We anticipate that target lists for the first sector to be available within a few weeks of launch. When available, we will make that information available.
