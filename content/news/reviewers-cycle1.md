The TESS Community Science Center is responsible for organizing the review of proposals submitted to the TESS Guest Investigator program. Our first cycle deadline is anticipated to be in early approximately October, with the in-person peer review likely taking place in early December. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in astrophysics and exoplanet science to serve on our review panel. The requirements are that you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to Grad Students), and that you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 1 proposal (it's fine you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). 

Please get in touch with your areas of expertize to [tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov). As a guide we are anticipating on having panels made up of an approximately 50/50 split between postdocs and more senior scientist. Topics we are particularly interesting in recruiting reviewers for are exoplanet science, asteroseismology, stellar activity, binary stars, and supernova observations.
