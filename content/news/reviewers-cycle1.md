The TESS Science Support Center is responsible for organizing the review of proposals submitted to the TESS Guest Investigator program. Our first cycle deadline will be on September 29, 2017, with the in-person peer review likely taking place in mid-December. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in astrophysics and exoplanet science to serve on our review panel. The requirements are that you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to graduate students), and that you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 1 proposal (it's fine if you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). 

Please get in touch by sending your name, institution, and areas of expertise to [tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov), or filling in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/p4ZqiTQSEHjbM6nz2). As a guide, we are anticipating having panels made up of an approximately 50/50 split between postdocs and more senior scientists. Topics we are particularly interested in recruiting reviewers for are exoplanet science, asteroseismology, stellar activity, binary stars, and supernova observations.
