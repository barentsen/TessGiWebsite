TESS team members and scientists participated in a number of successful events at the [231st American Astronomical Society](https://aas.org/meetings/aas231) meeting in National Harbor, MD, in January 2018. [TESS activities](tess-team-at-aas-231.html) included a joint evening splinter session on NASA's TESS and K2 missions, a special seminar for science writers, and a number of talks, posters, and hyperwall presentations. Team members from MIT and NASA Goddard were also on hand to answer questions about the mission and feasibility of planned observations at a TESS booth in the exhibition hall, and there was much excitement for the upcoming launch throughout the meeting. 

A special [TESS Science Writers Guide](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/tesssciencewritersguidedraft23.pdf) was out together
