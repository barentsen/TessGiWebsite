The popular tool for determining when a target will be observed by TESS -- [Web TESS Viewing Tool (WTV)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py) -- has been updated to include both year 1 and year 2 of TESS.

Below is an image of the first Cycle 2 sector, showing just camera 3. The Kepler field is overlaid on the image.
