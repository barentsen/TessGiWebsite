The [230th American Astronomical Society](https://aas.org/meetings/aas230) is just around the corner. Team members from TESS's Science Support Center will be there to represent the mission. Come find us at at our booth where we will be joined by NExScI, Kepler/K2 and the Exoplanet Program Office. We will be available to answer your questions and help you understand the feasibility of planned observations.
