To aid in the development in potential TESS science investigations we have created a [TESS Observatory Guide](docs/TESS_observatory_guide_v1.1.pdf). This document serves two purposes. The first is to provide a comprehensive description of the TESS  observatory design, operations, and capabilities. The second is to provide potential proposers detailed information relevant to preparing proposals for the  TESS GI program. This includes descriptions of  TESS data processing and data products and GI program procedures, services, and tools.

This is a living document. Comments are greatly appreciated.
