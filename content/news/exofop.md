[ExoFOP-TESS](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/) is a web-based service developed and operated by the [NASA Exoplanet Science Institute](http://nexsci.caltech.edu) (NExScI) and the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu) to optimize resources and facilitate collaboration in follow-up studies of targets observed by TESS. [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu) serves as a repository for community-gathered follow-up data by allowing upload and display of data and derived astrophysical parameters, and has been widely used by the Kepler and K2 Follow-Up Observation Programs.

In the initial release of [ExoFOP-TESS](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/), overview pages for each of the 10.8 million stars in the [TESS Candidate Target list (CTL)](proposing-investigations.html#candidate-target-list-ctl) have been created. These pages contain data from the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) Version 5, including coordinates, magnitudes, stellar parameters, and planet parameters (if available). The pages also contain external links to other archives, and all content can be viewed without logging in. The ability to upload data and parameters and to search the CTL targets will be coming soon. 

See our [ExoFOP-TESS](followup.html#exoplanet-follow-up-observing-program-exofop) page for more details.
