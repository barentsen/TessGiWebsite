The [TESS Cycle 3 proposal call](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={21B53A82-2F78-9C26-3CA6-B9FEFE2AF929}&path=open)
was released in
October. Proposals are due on January 16, 2020 at 4.30pm EST.

We encourage those interested in submitting a proposal to carefully
read the
[Call for Proposals](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={21B53A82-2F78-9C26-3CA6-B9FEFE2AF929}&path=open)
and the information available on our website regarding [proposing investigations](proposing-investigations.html).

We remind proposers that in Cycle 3, two new observing modes will potentially be
available and collected at ["shared risk"](proposing-investigations.html#shared-risk-science): 10-minute cadence full-frame images and 20-second
cadence postage stamps. A 2-minute cadence mode will also be available
as in previous cycles. There is also a new Key Project proposal
category, and ground-based observing focused programs are also
solicited. We also emphasize that in the extended mission, all postage stamp targets will be
selected via this Guest Investigator Program or via the [Director's
Discretionary Targets Program](proposing-investigations.html#directors-discretionary-targets).

TESS Cycle 3 observations will be collected during the first year of the extended mission,
running from July 2020 until June 2021. All Cycle 3 fields are in the
Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. The
[Web TESS Viewing Tool](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py)
has been updated to include the Cycle 3 pointings, so that proposers
can determine when a target is expected to be observed by TESS.

Proposers may also be interested in the templates we have created to
assist in putting together a proposal. [The templates can be found on
our website.](proposing-investigations.html#proposal-templates)

Proposers requesting short-cadence target slots (either 20-second or
2-minute cadence) need to submit a target list along with the
proposal. Information on [how to create a target table](proposing-investigations.html#target-table) can be found on
our website, which also includes a link to a tutorial provided by the MAST.

Any questions regarding proposing to the TESS Cycle 3 call should be
addressed to [tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov](tesshelp@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov).
