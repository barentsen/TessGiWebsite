Title: Target list pointers

The proposal deadline is just over a week away and many of you are deep into the proposal writing process. Here are two small reminders/requests for target lists.

* TESS Guest Investigator Cycle 1 is awarding targets in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. Northern Ecliptic targets will be solicited in Cycle 2. Including targets that can't be observed won't technically impact your proposal - we will just remove them - but it may suggest to reviewers that you haven't done your homework.

* Your target lists should be in priority order. We many choose to award less than the full proposed target list; providing your targets in ranked order enables us to do this. For proposals with very large target lists, we recommend mentioning in the proposal the minimum number of target required to accomplish the scientific goals.
