Title: TESS Sessions at the AAS Meeting January 2019
Date: 2018-12-21 12:00
Author: Knicole Colon

The TESS team is looking forward to sharing our excitement about the
first science results, our high expectations for the two-year science
survey, and our plans for the extended mission, at the upcoming winter
AAS meeting in Seattle next month.

Stop by our booth in the exhibit
hall to find out how you can access data from the early observation
sectors, learn about promising planet candidates, propose new Guest
Investigator projects in Cycle 2, and get access to software tools for
analyzing target pixel files, light curves and full frame
images.

Be sure to join us for light snacks
and beverages during our special evening session on Monday, January 7
starting at 7:00pm, which will feature a mission update, early science results from
exoplanet discovery to stellar astrophysics and time domain astronomy,
and a Guest Investigator program update. You are also invited to
attend our two special
sessions taking place on Tuesday, January 8 at 10:00am and Thursday,
January 10 at 2:00pm to hear even more about the latest TESS results and plans for
exoplanets, stars and transients. Stop by the NASA traveling
Hyperwall on Wednesday, January 9, when two team members will present mission
overviews.

Please plan to join us at one or
more of these activities, and chat with us about how your own TESS
research projects are going, and what youâ€™d like to see in the
future. A summary of the TESS activities at AAS 233 is below.
