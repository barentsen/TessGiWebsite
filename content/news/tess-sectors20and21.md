Title: Replacement of Sectors20 and 21 data
Date: 2020-04-22 16:00
Author: Rebekah Hounsell

Sectors 20 and 21 will be replaced with newly exported data files starting April 2020. During the ingest the data files will be a disparate set of both the original and new files. Upon completion of the ingest the check boxes in the [data holdings table](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service) will be replaced with 'v2'.


The reasons for this re-delivery include changes in how the data quality flags for stray and scattered light are set. It also includes a correction to the time and to the full-frame image (FFI) collateral pixels. For more information, see the 'Memo' listed next to the [data release notes](http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/tess_drn.html) for DRN27 and DRN29. These memos's include information on how one can tell the difference between new and old data files.
