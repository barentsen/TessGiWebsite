Date: 2018-10-04 13:00
Author: Elisa Quintana

The deadline for regular [abstract submission](https://aas.org/meetings/aas233/abstracts) of the 233rd AAS meeting in Seattle has been extended to Wednesday, 10 October (9:00 pm ET).


A Special Session "TESS: Early Results and Future Plans‚Äù is scheduled for Tuesday, 8 January, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM and will consist of invited speakers and contributed talks. Due to technical difficulties with the abstract submission system, this session was not appearing in the list of Special Sessions accepting contributed talks. This session is now an option, so we encourage you to consider submitting your abstract to this session (or modifying your submission if you have already submitted). This can be done by selecting the "Special Sessions Accepting Orals" under Session Type, and selecting "TESS: Early Results and Future Plans" under Category. Abstracts not selected for the Special Session will go to the general pool of abstracts.

We also plan to hold a TESS evening Splinter Session and will have an exhibit booth at AAS. Stay tuned for more information on these additional TESS activities at AAS. We thank you and look forward to hearing all about your TESS plans and research!
