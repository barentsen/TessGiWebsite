Recent tests at MIT have shown the cameras on TESS are slightly out of focus when placed in the cold temperatures of space where it will be operating. After a thorough engineering evaluation, NASA have concluded TESS can fully accomplish its science mission with the cameras as they are, and we will proceed with current integration activities. Information on the impact that this will have on photometric precision will be forthcoming. The largest impact will be to faint stars and the impact relatively minimal for most stars brighter than about 13th magnitude.
