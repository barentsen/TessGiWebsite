Due to the partial government shutdown, the TESS Guest Investigator (GI) Program Cycle 2 deadline has been changed. The new Phase-1 due date (via ARK RPS) is 4:30 pm March 14, 2019.

At this time we will be soliciting programs that target Northern Ecliptic Hemisphere fields. The NSPIRES page is in the process of being updated. With the first release data planned forÂ before the end of January 2019, Cycle 2 PIs will have access to TESS data when preparing their proposals.
