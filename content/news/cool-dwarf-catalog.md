A paper describing efforts to create a catalog of cool dwarf stars for TESS target selection is available on [the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00193). This release details the stellar properties of dwarf stars cooler than 4000K, with the specific aim to help identify exoplanet search targets to be observed by TESS at 2-min cadence.

TESS has the opportunity to search tens of thousands of nearby, cool, late K and M-type dwarfs for transiting exoplanets, an order of magnitude more than current or previous transiting exoplanet surveys. This  catalog is incorporated into the [TESS Input Catalog](proposing-investigations.html#tess-input-catalog-tic) and TESS Candidate Target List(proposing-investigations.html#candidate-target-list-ctl).
