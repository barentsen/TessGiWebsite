As previously announced, the field-of-view of the TESS camera array was shifted north by 31Â° with respect to its nominal pointing in Sectors 14, 15, and 16 in order to reduce the impact of scattered light from the Earth and Moon.

The TESS project has determined that photometry from TESS would further benefit by shifting the pointing of Sectors 24, 25, and 26 as well. These sectors will be observed between April 15, 2020 and July 4, 2020. [The status of all TESS sectors and data availability can be found here.](status.html)

[Additional details on the pointing change can be found at the MIT TESS website](https://tess.mit.edu/observations/) and correspondingly on the [Technical Details page of our website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/observing-technical.html).

The [Web TESS Viewing Tool (WTV)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py) that is hosted on our website has been updated to reflect the change in pointing for Sectors 24, 25, and 26.
