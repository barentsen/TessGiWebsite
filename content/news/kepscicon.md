We will be hosting a breakout session at the Kepler Science Conference, at NASA Ames, CA.
The session will be at 1.30pm on Wednesday Jun 21 and will focus on allowing the community to talk directly to the TESS Science Support Center team, and additionally talk to the folks from the ExoFOP team. So please come along, and engage. We might also have some coloring books and stickers.
