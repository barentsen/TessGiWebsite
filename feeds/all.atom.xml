Although these future Campaigns are at risk of not being executed
due to Kepler running low on fuel,
there is a significant chance that the spacecraft will continue to function
well into 2018 and the project must be ready to observe fields accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to optimize these future fields based on potential science.
We are now soliciting feedback from the community on the
placement of fields 17 and 18.
Example options which satisfy K2's pointing constraints are shown below.
When submitting your input, please keep in mind
that we can only shift the field along the ecliptic between these options,
not up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We ask that all requests for field placements be received by
April 11 and be &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ9hfrCBbRKsbHF-0cMO-orQMaijXnC_5pHfezp29Q81wFPg/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;submitted via this Google Form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
Advocacy that was submitted in recent months via e-mail
will be taken into account as well.
We anticipate announcing the final field positions in early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions may be addressed to &lt;a href="keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov"&gt;keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-17-example-forward-facing-options"&gt;Campaign 17: Example forward-facing options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 17 is designated to have a forward-facing field
to enable simultaneous observations from the Earth.
Possible field options are outlined in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all options have a start date of 3 March 2018,
i.e. 5 days after the end of Campaign 16.
The first option is very short in duration
due to its partial overlap in observing geometry with C16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-18-example-forward-facing-options"&gt;Campaign 18: Example forward-facing options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field for Campaign 18 largely depends on the location of the Campaign
17 field as well as whether or not Campaign 18 will be posited as a
forward-facing or backward-facing field. If we allow Campaign 18 to begin 5 days after the end of
each of the three options for Campaign 17 noted above, then we obtain
the following options listed below in the case of a forward-facing field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="panel panel-primary" style="max-width:40em;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="panel-heading"&gt;

     &lt;td&gt;86 days&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;17 modules of C9*&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;May 13 - Aug 09, 2018&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;88 days&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;9 modules of C7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;May 28 - Aug 25, 2018&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;88 days&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tdata&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


* C9 was the microlensing experiment where pixels were primarily collected
  around the Galactic bulge. Therefore, the distribution of targets
  across modules was not uniform in that campaign.

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-18-example-backward-facing-options"&gt;Campaign 18: Example backward-facing options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these are the C18 options for the backward-facing geometry,
in which case Earth is kept out of the field but
simultaneous observations from the ground would be challenging:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

     &lt;td&gt;May 13 - Aug 09, 2018&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;88 days&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;14 modules of C5 and C16&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;May 28 - Aug 25, 2018&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;li&gt;171, 172, 173 (C17);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;181, 182, 183 (C18 forward-facing);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;184, 185, 186 (C18 backward-facing).&lt;/li&gt;

These are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the project's true data products:
by late May, the routine pipeline processing of the K2 data will be completed
and vetted, and the fully calibrated data made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage our community to share their 
understanding of the raw data with the public by blogging or tweeting
tutorials and analyses. 
This public TRAPPIST-1 data set offers a unique opportunity
to let a wider audience witness the process scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this blog post summarizes the caveats
associated with the raw data,
describes the availability of preliminary Target Pixel Files,
and offers a quick-look at the TRAPPIST-1 light curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="raw-data-caveats"&gt;Raw data caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their format and caveats.
In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the raw data are not flat-fielded, bias-subtracted, or smear-corrected;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cadences of poor quality, e.g. due to thruster firings, are not flagged;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data are formatted in a non-standard way 
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza"&gt;require reformatting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, during Campaign 12, a cosmic ray event reset
the spacecraft's onboard software causing a five-day break
in science data collection from Feb 1st through Feb 6th.
The benign event is the fourth occurrence of a cosmic ray susceptibility
since launch in March 2009 and the spacecraft remains healthy
and operating nominally otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pseudo-target-pixel-files"&gt;Pseudo Target Pixel Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1 was observed
using a 11x11 short-cadence mask with EPIC ID 200164267
from Dec 15th, 2016, through Mar 4th, 2017.
To help the community explore this target,
the Guest Observer Office reformatted the raw data into a
&lt;em&gt;pseudo&lt;/em&gt; Target Pixel Files
using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza"&gt;Kadenza tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files are available for download from Zenodo
(DOI &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.375796"&gt;10.5281/zenodo.375796&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long cadence: &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/375796/files/k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-long-cadence.fits.gz"&gt;k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-long-cadence.fits.gz&lt;/a&gt; (2 MB)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to traditional Target Pixel Files, the FLUX values
in these files are &lt;strong&gt;not corrected for smear or bias,
and not all header keywords are populated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quick-look-at-trappist-1"&gt;Quick look at TRAPPIST-1&lt;/h2&gt;

reveals sinusoidal patterns due to star spots, and at least 6 planets:&lt;/p&gt;

direction along its velocity vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will change in Campaign 16 (Dec 2017 - Feb 2018),
when K2 will observe in the forward-facing direction
to enable observations in a field
that can easily be accessed from Earth at the same time.
This will enable K2's single-bandpass photometry to be
complemented with simultaneous observations from the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community secure observing resources for this opportunity
ahead of the upcoming proposal deadlines,
the project has prepared a preliminary list of 16,000 targets which
are planned to be observed during the Campaign.
The list is available as a CSV file (&lt;a href="data/campaigns/c16/k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv"&gt;k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv&lt;/a&gt;)
and contains five columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPIC ID (empty if not in EPIC);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RA (decimal degrees);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dec (decimal degrees);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kp (magnitude);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programs (pipe-delimited list of program IDs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list does not include short cadence mode, Solar System bodies,
and custom masks (such as M67, the core of which is likely to be observed
using a ~0.5°-by-0.5° super-mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final list of ~25,000 targets will be available by Nov 2017
and is expected to include all targets from the preliminary list,
save a small number of targets which prove to be unobservable
due to falling close to the edge of the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: Campaign 16 will run from December 7th, 2017,
through February 25th, 2018.
The field is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer (RA 9h, Dec +19°).
The line of sight shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag)
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic
and &lt;a href="supernova-experiment/"&gt;supernova science&lt;/a&gt;.
The field also contains the well-known clusters M44 (Beehive) and M67.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;
        1 Comet (246P/NEAT).
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a total of &lt;b&gt;33 bright stars&lt;/b&gt; (Kp 0-6),
including &lt;b&gt;Aldebaran&lt;/b&gt; and more than 15 members
of the Hyades,
are being observed using a custom 40-pixel diameter circular aperture mask.
Such circular masks capture the PSF cores while excluding
the long saturation columns which tend to bleed off silicon.
Nine bright Hyades members are also being observed in short cadence
using a similar custom mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Kepler and K2 missions deliver high-precision space-borne photometry which impact all areas of astrophysics in unique and important ways, including exoplanet science, stellar astrophysics, extragalactic physics, and solar system science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler/K2 Science Center is seeking to fill multiple staff positions within the Kepler and K2 Guest Observer (GO) Office at NASA’s Ames Research Center.  Responsibilities of the GO Office are to provide an interface between mission operations and the diverse academic community, to help execute and vet new K2 observations, to provide technical support for the scientific exploitation of the data by developing open source software tools, and to support outreach activities.  Details of the GO Office’s activities can be found at keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support Scientists will be encouraged to develop an independent astronomical research program.  Ideally, this research would involve active collaboration with Kepler/K2 community scientists and staff.   The development of synergies between Kepler/K2 science and NASA’s upcoming TESS and JWST missions is particularly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is expected to last around 2 years, depending on Kepler’s fuel usage, and may continue thereafter depending on the mission’s close-out funding.  The position comes with a competitive salary for the Silicon Valley area ($95-$115k commensurate with experience) plus health, vision, and dental insurance, and retirement contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications: PhD in science or equivalent experience; broad understanding of astronomical and/or exoplanet science; open source software development skills; excellent communication skills.  Additional desirable experience includes familiarity with the Python/AstroPy ecosystem, the GitHub platform, and web development skills.  Experience in a science support role and/or direct experience with Kepler data is beneficial, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These jobs will entail significant travel in support of the Kepler/K2 community.  The positions are funded through a cooperative agreement between NASA and the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (&lt;a href="http://www.baeri.org"&gt;www.baeri.org&lt;/a&gt;).
To apply send a CV, a list of three references, and a summary of science interests and relevant technical skills (maximum 3 pages for the summary) to &lt;a href="mailto:resumes@baeri.org"&gt;resumes@baeri.org&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Applications will be reviewed starting February 20, 2017, and will continue to be considered thereafter until March 31, 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;  Applicants should expect to receive a confirmation after submission.&lt;/p&gt;

of their format and caveats.
The &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza"&gt;kadenza tool&lt;/a&gt; may be used

The traditional pipeline-processed calibrated data products will be released 
within 2 to 3 months after the end of the Campaign, as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to release the raw data was triggered by
a request from members of the K2 community.
Similar requests may be made for future Campaigns

This is an exciting area of astrophysics that will only continue to grow over the coming years. The organizer of the event is Jennifer Johnson from Ohio State University and the session will take place in the Grapevine B room of the Gaylord Texan Resort &amp;amp; Convention Center and starts at 10am. The astract of the session below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exquisite lightcurves of the Kepler and K2 missions have been an unexpected boon to the field of near-field cosmology. Ages and evolutionary states can now be derived for field red giants, by combining asteroseismology with spectroscopic data. Red giants, far more luminous than the main-sequence turnoff stars usually used, allow us to probe the evolution of the whole Galaxy. Originally these investigations were restricted to a single line of sight of the Kepler field. With the failure of two of the reaction wheels and the start of the K2 program to observe many fields along the ecliptic, we now probe distinctly different Galactic populations, including the inner and outer disks, the bulge-halo interface, and far more of the Galactic halo. In K2, the Galactic Archaeology Program has been awarded the second largest number of targets, with over 50,000 stars targeted to understand the formation of the Milky Way. The data from the Kepler field has already been used to calibrate the largest age map yet made of the Galaxy, and we are just beginning to explore this vast dataset. The ongoing release of Kepler/K2 light curves and the public availability of follow-up spectra for thousands of targets over the last year alone indicates that this is an ideal time to discuss the most recent breakthroughs in the rapidly evolving field of Galactic archeologyIn this special session, we will discuss the extensive follow-up work underway to make Galactic archaeology possible, discuss how Kepler/K2 data in stellar clusters reveals the history of stellar activity, and present the pioneering results of Galactic archaeology. These include investigations of the age spread in the Galactic halo, examination of the vertical and radial age gradients in the thick and thin disk, measurement of the timescales for chemical evolution, calibration of age indicators for even larger age maps, and discussion of synergies with Gaia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in detail in the &lt;a href="/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-10"&gt;data release notes&lt;/a&gt;,
the data were processed in two separate sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first six days of data, dubbed C10a, were collected with a pointing error of 3.3 pixels from the nominal field-of-view, so they were only processed through CAL to make Type 1 target pixel files and collateral data files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remainder of the campaign, dubbed C10b, was processed through the entire photometry pipeline, creating Type 2 target pixel files, long-cadence light curves, and collateral data files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C10a files are known in the archive under Campaign number 101,
and the C10b files have Campaign number 102.
A search for Campaign 10 will return both sets of files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complexity is that &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;Module 4 was lost part way through C10b&lt;/a&gt;,
which powered off the photometer and produced a 14-day data gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, long cadence custom masks are scheduled to observe
&lt;b&gt;19 Trojan asteroids&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;9 Trans-Neptunian Objects&lt;/b&gt;,
and &lt;b&gt;4 Comets&lt;/b&gt; (90P/Gehrels, 95P/Chiron, 176P/LINEAR, 228P/LINEAR).
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled
using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips.
Most notably, the well-known &lt;b&gt;Centaur 95P/Chiron&lt;/b&gt;
will be observed for the entire duration of the campaign in long cadence
(mask ID range 200164175–200164266)
and for 20 days in short cadence (IDs 200161173–200162430).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the original plan,
the Campaign 12 field was rotated and shifted slightly
in order to &lt;a href='/small-changes-to-campaigns-13-14-and-15.html'&gt;optimize spacecraft stability&lt;/a&gt; and to ensure the visibility of TRAPPIST-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better compensate for the radiation pressure exerted by one of the
spacecraft's low-gain antennae, these fields have been rotated by 0.365°.
This change minimizes the roll drift rate and
hence optimizes fuel usage and photometric precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change affects less than 1% of the sky area covered and is unlikely
to affect most Cycle 5 proposals.
All users are nevertheless encouraged to update the 
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt; target selection tool
to version 6.2, released on 14 Nov 2016, which includes the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -c "import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This must return "6.2.0" or higher. If the number is lower, or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated and must be upgraded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 16 does not require a change due to the use of a different,
forward-facing spacecraft configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

the &lt;a href="new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 16 field has been changed&lt;/a&gt;
to enable a forward-facing supernova survey.
In addition to benefiting from low galactic extinction,
the new field allows simultaneous observations to be made from the ground
to complement K2’s single-bandpass photometry,
i.e. allowing K2's supernovae to be characterized spectroscopically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey is called the &lt;strong&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.
Its aims include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitoring &lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;20,000 galaxies&lt;/strong&gt; to gather a statistical sample of the &lt;strong&gt;best supernovae lightcurves ever obtained&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;catching the critical &lt;strong&gt;first few hours&lt;/strong&gt; of supernovae, 
allowing different explosion physics and progenitors to be elucidated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the &lt;strong&gt;calibration of Type Ia supernovae&lt;/strong&gt; for cosmology 
by determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals to select and analyze K2 targets for this Campaign are eligible for &lt;strong&gt;funding up to $150,000&lt;/strong&gt;  as part of &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;K2 GO Cycle 5&lt;/a&gt;
(which also accepts proposals from all other areas of astrophysics and planetary science).
&lt;strong&gt;The Step 1 deadline is Nov 3, 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the supernova community plan the observations and follow-up,
the mission will be hosting a 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 
on &lt;strong&gt;Feb 14-16, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;,
at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivations for this workshop include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;planning the K2 observations with Kepler/K2 team members;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coordinating the simultaneous, ground-based follow-up observations and proposals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preparing the data analysis and interpretation efforts, e.g. informed by the previous supernovae observed by Kepler;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring synergies with other space missions, wavelength regions, and  science areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an unconference-style meeting with a limited number of introductory talks and a strong focus on participant-led breakout sessions. The final day will provide ample time for drafting papers and observing proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C9 was largely dedicated to a search for gravitational microlensing
events in a region around the Galactic bulge. A variety of other
targets were also observed through the K2 &lt;a href="k2-ddt.html"&gt;Director's Discretionary Target&lt;/a&gt; program.
These include O-type stars,the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar, and the Lagoon
star-forming region (M8). The complete list of observed targets can
be found &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique operations for this campaign, the C9
data release only contains Type-1 target pixel files and does not
include light curves. Also, the campaign was split into two halves (C9a
and C9b), with a data downlink taking place in between C9a and C9b to maximize
data collection capabilities as well as introduce a ~0.6 pixel
offset.  Archive products are therefore identified as being from
either C9a or C9b using the identifier c91 or c92, respectively. We strongly encourage users interested in C9 data

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-14"&gt;Campaign 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 14 (RA 11h, Dec +7°) is located at a moderately high Galactic Latitude (+50°)
towards the constellations of Leo and Sextans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable targets include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M96_Group"&gt;Leo I Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a group of nearby, bright galaxies that lie within the Local Supercluster. Its members include M95, M96, and M105.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-15"&gt;Campaign 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 15 (RA 16h, Dec -20°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+30°)
towards the constellation of Libra.  There is a small overlap with the previous Campaign 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable targets include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upper Sco&lt;/strong&gt;: a young, nearby OB association that was previously observed during C2. It is partially visible again in C15. Notable Upper Sco members that are visible in C15 include:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIP 78530&lt;/strong&gt;: a B-type star known from direct imaging to contain a planet or brown dwarf companion. (V=7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scorpii"&gt;δ Sco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright, B-type binary. (V=2)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33 Lib&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright roAp-type star. (V=7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD 134439 &amp;amp; HD 134440&lt;/strong&gt;: a metal-poor proper motion pair. (V=9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NGC 5897&lt;/strong&gt;: a distant, 12 Gyr-old globular cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu"&gt;Asteroid Ryugu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a near-Earth asteroid, scheduled to be visited by the Hayabusa 2 sample-return mission in 2018. (V=20)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951_Gaspra"&gt;Asteroid Gaspra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a main belt asteroid visited by the Galileo spacecraft in 1991. (V=16)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comet C/2014 W2&lt;/strong&gt;: a long-period comet. (V=18)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-16"&gt;Campaign 16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 16 (RA 9h, Dec +19°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer. About 30% of the field overlaps with the previous Campaign 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag) 
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic and supernova science.
This field will be observed in the spacecraft's forward-facing direction, enabling simultaneous observations to be made from the ground 
at the cost of having the bright Earth pass through the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable objects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M44&lt;/strong&gt; (aka Praesepe or the Beehive): a 600 Myr-old open cluster revealed by K2 Campaign 5 to contain several planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M67&lt;/strong&gt;: a famous, 4 Gyr-old open cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K2-34&lt;/strong&gt;: a known exoplanet host revealed by K2 Campaign 5. (V=11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cancri"&gt;Arkushanangarushashutu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright K-type giant, famous for being the star with the longest name. (V=4)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full table containing all Simbad sources that are visible in C14-15-16
can be downloaded from this website in CSV format (&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv"&gt;K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv&lt;/a&gt;) or as a VOTable (&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/raw/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz"&gt;K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz&lt;/a&gt;). Beware however that Simbad is not a full catalog of all known sources; it merely lists objects that have previously been discussed in the literature.
For the purpose of e.g. color-based target selections,
we recommend using a more complete source catalog, preferably the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC catalog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the &lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov Python package&lt;/a&gt; enables you to test whether targets fall within a campaign field,
while its sister &lt;a href="software.html#k2ephem"&gt;K2ephem package&lt;/a&gt;
allows moving Solar System bodies to be checked.
Note that it is crucial to use K2fov version 6.0 or higher for Campaigns 14-15-16.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>New forward-facing position of Campaign 16 finalized</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-23T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-23T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2016-09-23:/new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="change-to-campaign-16-field-position-and-delay-to-go-cycle-5-deadline.html"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; that in order to maximize the science return from the remaining fuel, K2 Campaign 16 will now be a forward-facing campaign.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;position of this field&lt;/a&gt; has been finalized. The position was chosen to maximize the number of known low-redshift galaxies, while also enabling the collection of a significant fractions of both M67 and the Beehive cluster (aka Praesepe, M44). The campaign will begin around December 7, 2017 and last approximately 80 days. Campaign 16 has a 30% overlap with the Campaign 5 field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether targets fall on-silicon, all investigators must update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;
 and ensure they are using v6.2 or higher. &lt;/p&gt;

It can be accessed via the 
&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC query form&lt;/a&gt;
or it can be &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/catalogs.html"&gt;downloaded in full&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

the mission has decided to change the position of the field for Campaign 16
and to delay the upcoming K2 Cycle 5 deadline by about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of the Campaign 16 field is being changed to facilitate
supernova science. Recent estimates of the remaining fuel on the
Kepler spacecraft indicate that Campaign 17 is at risk. Campaign 17 was
intended to have a primary science focus of supernova science. In
order to enable detailed characterization of supernovae, Campaign
17 would be a forward-facing campaign (much like the C9 microlensing campaign).
Observing in this mode allows for simultaneous observations from K2 and from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maximize the science return from the K2 mission, we are changing the position of the field for Campaign 16.
Campaign 16 will now involve the Kepler spacecraft observing in the forward-facing direction, and a significant fraction of pixels will
be dedicated to supernova science. The new pointing for Campaign 16
will have significant overlap with the field observed during Campaign 5.
&lt;strong&gt;The final field position will be posted to this website in the near future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, proposals are currently being solicited for K2 GO Cycle 5, which includes &lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;Campaigns 14, 15, and 16&lt;/a&gt;.
While Campaign 16 will be partially dedicated to supernova science, proposals covering all other areas of astrophysics and planetary science are still encouraged for Campaign 16. 
In particular, we encourage K2 observations that can benefit from simultaneous observations from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these changes to the Campaign 16 field, the
Step 1 and Step 2 proposal deadlines have been revised.
&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 proposals are now due by 23:59 EST 3 November 2016, and Step 2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST 15 December 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;
Investigators may not submit a Step 2 proposal without first submitting a Step 1 proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposers should only propose for  targets that are on active silicon in the updated Campaign 16  field. All investigators must update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;
once the new field position of Campaign 16 has been announced.
The field position currently configured in K2fov v5.2 is preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C11 target list includes &lt;b&gt;14,209 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;65 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets.
The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field targeted by this Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gained efficiency by tiling &lt;b&gt;five globular clusters—M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5&lt;/b&gt;—which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular aperture because it fell only partially on silicon.
Each cluster was tiled using a series of masks with the following ID ranges:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200126982–200127109 (M9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200126870–200126870 (M19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200127326–200127413 (NGC 6293)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200127414–200127501 (NGC 6355)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128019–200128100 (Terzan 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target list also includes &lt;b&gt;11 very bright stars&lt;/b&gt; (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) for which we target only the central region of pixels using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp;amp; 36 Oph) and
the others in long cadence. Their target IDs are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200129034 (26 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200129035 (36 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128906 (θ Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128907 (44 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128908 (45 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128909 (51 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128910 (ο Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128911 (HR 6472)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128912 (HR 6365)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128913 (HR 6366)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128914 (191 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will also observe &lt;b&gt;55 Trojan asteroids&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7 Trans-Neptunian Objects&lt;/b&gt;, and Saturn's moons &lt;b&gt;Titan and Enceladus&lt;/b&gt;.
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips. The ID ranges for these objects are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200107039–200128905 (Trojans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200114742–200125326 (TNOs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128938–200129033 (Titan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200124091–200124403 (Enceladus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is the first campaign to be executed after the &lt;a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'&gt;loss of CCD Module 4&lt;/a&gt;.
Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
and no program lost more than 20%.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Changes to Kepler and K2 Project Scientist personnel</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/changes-to-kepler-and-k2-project-scientist-personnel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-08T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-08T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2016-09-08:/changes-to-kepler-and-k2-project-scientist-personnel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There have been personnel changes at the Kepler and K2 Project Scientist role.&lt;/p&gt;

additional spacecraft telemetry appears to confirm the loss of CCD Module 4
during K2's current Campaign 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module 4 is the third of the 21 science modules to have failed in-flight.
Such hardware failures were foreseen in the initial mission planning, and the system design is robust and compartmentalized to minimize the impacts. After more than seven years in the harsh conditions of space, 85 percent of Kepler's original detectors are still operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 10 science observations &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;were interrupted between July 20 and August 3&lt;/a&gt;
as a result of the anomaly.
Observations have since returned to normal
and no further interruptions are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact-on-go-programs"&gt;Impact on GO programs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the K2 mission’s current Campaign 10, the targets that fell on Module 4 &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;will yield no data beyond July 20&lt;/a&gt;.
For all campaigns going forward, we will only allocate pixels to targets which fall on one of the remaining 18 operational modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average 4% of the targets requested by selected GO programs fell on the retired Module, with no single program affected by more than 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pixel storage budget that would have been used by Module 4 during future Campaigns will be re-allocated to other Modules, allowing the total number of
K2 targets to remain unchanged.
The impact on science is expected to be small as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the high-profile targets in future Campaigns, such as Trappist-1 or Comet Chiron, are known to be affected.
Investigators who are concerned about a particular target are encouraged to contact us at &lt;a href="keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov"&gt;keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="where-is-module-4"&gt;Where is Module 4?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ill-fated Module is located on the outside of the focal plane,
where both the pointing stability and the point spread function are less ideal.
Its position is marked using a pen in the photograph below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial line of sight pointing of the spacecraft at the start of the campaign was offset from its intended target by 12 arcsec, sufficient to lose much of the expected target light from the assigned apertures. This error was compounded by a downlink issue that failed to provide the requisite focal plane data that is intended to catch such errors. These data were subsequently acquired and pointing corrected on July 13.  Although the spacecraft was in fine point throughout, the pointing offset will compromise much of the data for the first week of observations, and is likely to more seriously affect those targets near the edge of the focal plane where roll is largest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on July 20, the photometers was turned off as an apparent response to a failure of a module on the focal plane. The spacecraft otherwise continued to operate normally, and the anomaly was not discovered until a scheduled data downlink on July 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With extremely poor communication geometry at science attitude, spacecraft health checks consume significant DSN resources, requiring a 70-meter antenna.  Such health checks are therefore performed infrequently during the K2 mission, roughly every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cause of this is yet to be confirmed, the observables are in family with those seen in conjunction with the failure of science CCD Modules 3 and 7 in 2010 and 2014.  Further, thermal data retrieved from the spacecraft are strongly suggestive of a drop in power dissipated by Module 4 that is again in family with a similar drop when Modules 3 and 7 failed.  Thus there is a strong likelihood that Module 4 is no longer functioning.  If this is indeed the case, this would leave us with 18 remaining science modules of the initial 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook a recovery which involved reorienting the spacecraft to attain higher data rate communications with Earth and carefully powering on the various components that had been switched off, and science observations resumed on August 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the thermal data, the Campaign 11 target apertures located on Module 4 are being reassigned to targets on other modules.  We anticipate being able to confirm the health of the suspect module at the next planned health check on August 11 and further updates will be provide thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like this module failure are things that happen with an aging spacecraft. For future campaigns we will reallocate pixels to active modules as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Release of reprocessed short cadence data for K2 Campaigns 3, 4, 5</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/release-of-reprocessed-short-cadence-data-for-k2-campaigns-3-4-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T14:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T14:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Geert Barentsen</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2016-08-02:/release-of-reprocessed-short-cadence-data-for-k2-campaigns-3-4-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reprocessed short cadence target pixel files for K2 Campaigns 3, 4, and 5

has been posted online.
The target list includes 28,345 standard long cadence
and 138 short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the high galactic latitude of the field,
the standard long cadence targets include 4,950 small galaxies.
In addition, 27 larger galaxies are targeted using custom pixel masks.
The short cadence list includes the well-known extragalactic object &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273"&gt;3C 273&lt;/a&gt;, which is the optically brightest quasar in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, large pixel masks will be obtained to cover 11 Hilda asteroids, 4 TNOs, 
and comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko which is currently being investigated by the Rosetta mission.
Finally, K2 will also observe 8 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Save the date for Kepler &amp; K2 SciCon IV, June 19-23, 2017</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/save-the-date-for-kepler-k2-scicon-iv-june-19-23-2017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-31T11:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-05-31T11:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2016-05-31:/save-the-date-for-kepler-k2-scicon-iv-june-19-23-2017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Kepler &amp;amp; K2 SciCon IV: Legacy &amp;amp; Scion will take place June 19-23, 2017, at NASA Ames Research Center in California.

To allow such events to be identified and characterized rapidly,
the raw data of this campaign are being released instantly
through the data archive at MAST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data obtained during the first half
of C9 (Apr 22 - May 18) are now available at

to NASA's &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&amp;amp;solId=%7BE2458B76-679E-DD13-4075-005651FF0CEE%7D&amp;amp;path=open"&gt;Discovery Data Analysis Program (DDAP)&lt;/a&gt;
permits the submission of proposals for work on Kepler/K2 observations
of solar system targets.
The objective of the DDAP program is to enhance the scientific return
of Discovery Program missions by broadening the scientific participation
in the analysis of data, both recent and archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program intends to fund solar system science.
Proposals using Kepler/K2 observations of objects outside the solar system are not eligible and should be submitted to the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) instead. A non-exhaustive list of K2's solar system targets is given below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted on the spacecraft by solar pressure, the K2 mission entails a series of sequential &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;observing Campaigns&lt;/a&gt; of fields distributed around the ecliptic.
A result of this observing strategy is that the K2 fields
contain a large number of solar system targets,
which can be observed to provide high-cadence, uninterrupted light curves
to e.g. measure rotation periods, constrain object shapes and spin states,
and search for activity in comets or oscillations in giant planets.
Because Solar System objects move relative to the celestial sphere,
long streaks of pixels are downloaded from the Kepler spacecraft to cover
their trajectory (or part thereof).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solar-system-targets-in-campaigns-0-11"&gt;Solar system targets in Campaigns 0-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K2 mission has so far targeted 163 solar system objects during
Campaigns 0 through 11 as part of the
&lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;approved observing programs&lt;/a&gt;.
These objects are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive because thousands of objects are known
to have serendipitously been observed for short periods of time
as they passed through the pixel masks of other targets.
A list of these serendipitously-observed targets is not available at this time,
but note that the visibility of solar system targets in past or future K2 Campaigns
can be checked using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem command-line tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This algorithm simultaneously models astrophysical variability and pointing systematics, enabling the user to disentangle the two and remove either or both. These light curves are therefore well-suited to searches for transits and other short-lived events in the light curves of variable active stars, or to studying stellar variability.

&lt;p&gt;In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. There were also several custom targets.  We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed &lt;a href="/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-7"&gt;data release notes&lt;/a&gt; are available on the Kepler &amp;amp; K2 Science Center website.  We encourage users to read these carefully; in particular, note that there was an increase in roll drift in Campaign 7 due to the use of an alternate low-gain antenna during science data collection.  This increase in roll motion, combined with an extremely crowded field, impacted the photometry produced by the Kepler pipeline.  Additional details are available in the full data release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Kepler recovered and K2 mission underway again</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-22T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-04-22T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2016-04-22:/kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Kepler spacecraft has officially been recovered since it was

of a puzzling difference between the short- and long-cadence
calibrated pixel data for a specific K2 target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the problem was traced to an accounting error
for the short-cadence collateral smear data.
Under some conditions, these data are passed incorrectly
between the spacecraft and the ground, causing smear values to be
assigned to the wrong columns within a target’s aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the pipeline’s pixel-level calibration routine
applies an erroneous smear correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has been present since launch and affects both the target pixel
files and the light curves of approximately
half of all short-cadence targets in all releases to date,
i.e. Kepler Data Releases 1-24 and K2 Data Releases for Campaigns 0-5.
A list of all the affected targets is attached below.
The long cadence data for these or other targets is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the smear signal is often small compared to the target signal,
the effect is negligible for many targets.
However, the smear signal is scene-dependent,
so time-varying signals can be introduced into an affected target
by the other stars falling on the same CCD column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact on affected targets,
users should inspect the calibrated target pixels
(see Section 2.3.2 of the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf"&gt;Kepler Archive Manual&lt;/a&gt;).
An improperly corrected smear signal may show up as an anomalously bright,
or dark, column in the calibrated target pixel image.
Comparison of the short-cadence pixel image with the long-cadence pixel image
(which is not affected by this problem)
can be used to estimate the magnitude of any contaminating signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler pipeline has been amended to ensure that the 
correct smear data is used at all times. 
All affected data will be corrected as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All upcoming K2 data releases will be corrected from the start,
 beginning with Campaign 6. (The release of C6 short cadence data will be delayed by approximately two weeks as a result.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reprocessing of K2 Campaigns 0-5 will occur over the coming months. The expected release dates will be listed here when known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the prime Kepler mission will be corrected as part of the scheduled reprocessing with pipeline release 9.3 (DR25). Corrected target pixel files are expected to be available in Summer 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

in the position of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13,
for which target proposals are currently being solicited as part of the 
&lt;a href="call-for-k2-go-cycle-4-proposals-for-campaigns-11-12-and-13.html"&gt;K2 Guest Observer Cycle 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change, explained below, alters ~0.2% of sky area covered
and is unlikely to affect the vast majority of proposals.
All users are nevertheless encouraged to update the 
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt; target selection tool
to version 4.0, which was released on 27 Jan 2016 to include the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -c "import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.require('K2fov')[0].version)"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should return "4.0.0" or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 are being rotated slightly to
accommodate a change in the configuration of the Kepler spacecraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these Campaigns, spacecraft telemetry will be downlinked
using a different low-gain antenna than before:
&lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;LGA1&lt;/i&gt;.
This antenna provides a better orientation to Earth
and compensates for the increasing range 
of the spacecraft to the Earth (now 0.8 AU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of antenna was recently trialled during Campaign 7,
where it was found to cause a small increase in the roll drift rate.
The reduced pointing performance was understood to be caused
by the antenna's radiation pressure,
which torques the spacecraft slightly differently when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is used,
increasing the roll rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To optimize fuel usage and photometric precision,
the K2 team has decided to adjust the roll angle
of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 by a very small amount
(0.12--0.16 degrees) to optimally balance the spacecraft
against solar pressure and antenna radiation
when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, there is a minor change in the fields of view covered by K2
during these campaigns. The position of the CCD edges
are being shifted by ~0.5 arcsec (~0.1 px) near the center of the
focal plane, and by up to 60 arcsec (~15 px) near the corners.
The change is illustrated in the figure below,
which shows the change in sky coverage for a single CCD channel
near the corner of C11,
where the shift is the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;fields of these campaigns&lt;/a&gt; 
will cover roughly 100 square degrees at a time near the
constellations of Ophiucus (C11), Aquarius (C12), and Taurus (C13).
All the objects that will be observed during these campaigns must be
requested by the community through the Cycle 4 call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community select and propose the most interesting targets,
the Guest Observer Office has prepared a "K2-SIMBAD" catalog which lists all 240,000 objects which appear in the &lt;a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr"&gt;SIMBAD database&lt;/a&gt; and will fall within the fields of future K2 Campaigns.
The catalog details object IDs, spectral types, object classifications, citation counts, proper motions, and selected photometry as recorded in SIMBAD. It can be &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/tree/master/simbad"&gt;downloaded in full from our GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K2-SIMBAD catalog does not replace the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC Input Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, which remains the principal target selection tool. Instead it provides an overview of objects that have appeared in the literature and may hence trigger or inspire K2 Cycle 4 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we list a selection of notable objects that we encountered in the  catalog, along with interesting Solar System bodies
that will be visible as determined by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem tool&lt;/a&gt;.  This list is not exhaustive by any means and we encourage members of the community to share missing highlights for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals must be accompanied by a &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;target table&lt;/a&gt; (by the Step 2 deadline) which details the objects
to be observed.
To enable the community to select and propose the most interesting targets,
the following resources are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (&lt;strong&gt;EPIC&lt;/strong&gt;) has been updated to include targets for Campaigns 11-13. The catalogs can be &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;queried online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/catalogs/"&gt;downloaded in text format&lt;/a&gt; from MAST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package has been updated to include the details of fields 11-12-13, along with the preliminary positions of fields 14 through 17. Installing the package adds two executables to the command line, &lt;em&gt;K2onSilicon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;K2findCampaigns&lt;/em&gt;, which allow the visibility of targets to be checked during one or all campaigns.  If you have a previous version of K2fov installed, it is crucial that you upgrade to version 3.0 or higher ("pip install K2fov --upgrade").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new package called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been built on top of K2fov to allow the visibility of Solar System bodies, i.e. asteroids and comets, to be checked in a user-friendly way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sky footprints&lt;/strong&gt; of past and future campaigns have been made available

The problem was traced to an error in the pipeline module that calibrates the pixels, specifically in how it handles the black model calculated by the Dynablack algorithm. As a result, the SC calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files, and the light curves based on these pixels, are excessively noisy.   All DR24 SC data processed by CAL using Dynablack are affected.  In other words, only the SC data from Q0, Q1 and Q17, as well as a few select channels in Q2--Q16, are valid.  Unfortunately, no flag exists in the DR24 data files to indicate whether a target was calibrated using Dynablack.  Users are encouraged to regress to an earlier data release, if they have the required files in their possession (i.e., these earlier releases are no longer available from the MAST archive), or they can wait for the next and final SC data release (DR25).   This calibration problem has been fixed and the final reprocessing is expected to be available in Summer, 2016.  There is no impact on the long-cadence data for either DR24 or DR25.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 9 Microlensing Science Team selected</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-06T15:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-11-06T15:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-11-06:/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 9&lt;/a&gt; will be executed in April 2016 and

Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft
observing in the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic
bulge. The aim of this program is to simultaneously observe
gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to
see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of experts. The aim of the MST
is to both coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 mission
regarding the best observational methods to use during Campaign 9,
allowing the highest value science return. Additionally, the MST will
serve the interests of the community by, for example, facilitating simultaneous
ground-based data collection, developing novel methods for crowded
field photometry, and providing completeness and reliability studies
of detected microlensing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MST is comprised of the following people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Bennett (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calen Henderson (JPL/Caltech)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop, called "NASA Planetary Science and Astrophysics Assets," will be held all day on Tuesday, 10 November 2015, in the Azalea 1 room at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;b&gt;9:00 am and 10:30 am&lt;/b&gt;, the workshop will focus on the K2 mission.
The schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 background (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Thomas Barclay, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting solar system bodies (10 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Geert Barentsen, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 support and the ExoFOP (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Rachel Akeson, NExScI&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observations of Neptune and Uranus (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Amy Simon (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing the limits of K2: observing distant, small Solar System bodies with Kepler (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Csaba Kiss (Konkoly Obs., Hungary)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trojan Asteroids (15 min) - &lt;i&gt;Erin Ryan (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A (5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields observed by K2 are close to the ecliptic plane
and rich in solar system objects including planets, asteroids 
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). 
K2 has already performed observations of Neptune and its large moon Triton, 68 Trojan and Hilda asteroids, 5 TNOs (including Pluto) and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). About thousands of main-belt asteroids that fell into the pixel masks of stars have been have been serendipitously observed. Uranus will be observed in a future campaign (C8), as will many more small solar system bodies. Observations of moving bodies as bright as Jupiter and as faint as V=23 have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 has an ongoing funded Guest Observer program and which has been successfully proposed to by members of the planetary science community. We present K2’s plans and capabilities for solar system science and will have presentations by members of the planetary science community who have used K2 data. This presentation contains information about the mission and its capabilities, discusses the proposal cycles and provides examples, and has community folks talking about their K2 science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage members of the planetary science community interested in using the long-baseline, high-cadence, high-precision photometry provided by the Kepler spacecraft to join the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Science Conference deadline fast approaching</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-15T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-15T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-09-15:/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The September 18 deadline for early registration, hotel reservation, &amp;amp; abstract submission for the &lt;a href="http://lcogt.net/k2scicon/"&gt;K2SciCon&lt;/a&gt; is just a few days away.

Given the proposal review timeline, and associated data processing and archive activities, there can be a significant delay between proposal submission and final target selection for each K2 campaign. To provide a faster mechanism for headline astrophysics with K2 we provide an alternative means for acquiring K2 data, through the Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DDT program for K2 is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yield high-impact science from K2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance existing GO programs with additional data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDT program for K2 occurs on a rolling basis; observations can be proposed for at any time starting with targets in Campaign 8. However, to ensure that approved targets are included in the final target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted by the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 5, 2015 for Campaign 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 10, 2015 for Campaign 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 10, 2016 for Campaign 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals require a 2-page scientific justification and a target table and should be &lt;a href="/k2-ddt.html"&gt;submitted on the DDT page&lt;/a&gt;. The required format as well as a &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;template for the target table can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 8, 9, and 10 are provided at &lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;the field information page&lt;/a&gt;. Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. DDT proposals will be sent to external reviewers; final selection will be at the discretion of the Guest Observer Office Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to observe several hundred targets through the DDT program, which amounts to a few per cent of the total targets allocated. The exact number of DDTs to be observed largely depends on the number of short versus long cadence DDTs approved. There is no proprietary period and no associated funding for approved DDT programs. Proposals from any institution are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We particularly encourage DDT proposals for Campaign 9, which is a non-standard campaign. The Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the positive velocity vector (+VV) direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. This allows for simultaneous observations from Earth during Campaign 9. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 7 science program available</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T15:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-10T15:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-7"&gt;Campaign 7 Target List&lt;/a&gt; has now been posted.

In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Updated K2 data release schedule</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T14:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-09-10T14:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.

In Campaign 4, 15,853 long cadence and 122 short cadence targets were observed. Additionally, large circular pixel masks were collected that cover bright 3-5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters.  Data for these nine stars are listed by custom aperture number at MAST, rather than by EPIC number.  A Trans-Neptunian Object (2002 KY14) was also observed, and 1340 pixel masks were collected to cover the trajectory of this moving target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href="/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt"&gt;887 stellar targets&lt;/a&gt; that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;

in the data processing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background level is now removed from the calibrated pixel flux provided
by the target pixel files (column FLUX), bringing the K2 TPF files in line
with those that were previously made available for the prime Kepler mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New quality flags now indicate which cadences were obtained during a thruster firing (column QUALITY).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet). These are the hooks that grab the attention of the public and spurs additional learning. A news hook can be obvious but can require discussion to ferret out the story.&lt;/p&gt;

The cluster was tiled with 73 individual apertures to create a contiguous 400x400 pixel region over two channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Additional targets available in future K2 campaigns</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/additional-targets-available-in-future-k2-campaigns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-02T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-02T05:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-06-02:/additional-targets-available-in-future-k2-campaigns.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As some of you prepare your K2 Cycle 3 proposal target lists I wanted to alert you to an increase in the number of targets that we can observe with K2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pointing has been significantly better than our conservative pointing assumptions we used when we built our pixel cost algorithms. The result of this is that we can observe about double the number of targets from Campaign 5 onwards compared with Campaign 4 and earlier. The increase is from about 15,000 total to around 30,000 total. Unfortunately, the telemetry data to determine that we were able to do this was no available in time for the K2 GO Cycle 2 proposal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect you? You may wish to consider submitting larger target lists than in previous cycles in any Cycle 3 proposals you are submitting. Now, as always there is a caveat here that you should not propose more target than you can justify but please be aware that the cost of a target is now lower.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Due date for K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 Step-1 proposal fast approaching</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-29T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-29T05:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2015-05-29:/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 proposal call is observations of targets in Campaigns 8 and 10.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Geert Barentsen joins us from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. Geert's background is in the exploitation of photometry from wide-area surveys. In Hertfordshire he leads the data processing of two projects which aim to map our own Milky Way in unprecedented detail: &lt;a href="http://www.iphas.org"&gt;IPHAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vphas.eu"&gt;VPHAS+&lt;/a&gt;. He also teaches a university's programming and statistics class, and is a contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.astropy.org"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert earned his doctorate at the Queen's University of Belfast in 2012 where he studied star formation using narrow-band photometry. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, after which he gained professional experience in data science at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium. In his spare time, he studies the activity of meteor showers using data collected by amateur astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Knicole Colón leaves a postdoctoral role at Lehigh University as a member of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilodegree_Extremely_Little_Telescope"&gt;KELT project&lt;/a&gt; to join us at Kepler. Her expertise is in the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student at the University of Florida, Knicole demonstrated the capability of OSIRIS on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) for exoplanet science.  After earning her doctorate in 2012, she gained postdoctoral experience at the University of Hawaii and Lehigh University.  There, she focused on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with narrow-band photometry and in the confirmation of planets around bright stars discovered by the KELT transit survey.&lt;/p&gt;

This data was collected between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, and points to a different region of sky to Campaign 0, RA = 359 deg, Dec = -2 deg. In future publications and presentations, we would be grateful if you referred to these data collectively as the "Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test". The motivation for delivering this test data is described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community in the endeavor of maximizing photometric quality and precision of a two-wheel mission we have delivered &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/"&gt;engineering data to the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The Kepler spacecraft operated with fine-guidance, collecting data from 2,017 target masks. The properties and quality of the data therein is expected to be similar to those collected during Campaign 0 and provide an excellent opportunity for scientists to make an early and impactful start upon their investigations. Note also that the chances of there being undiscovered planet transits in this engineering set are high and the potential for other serendipitous science is great. To this end we have also provided lists of &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_lc.csv"&gt;long cadence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_sc.csv"&gt;short cadence&lt;/a&gt; targets with a brief description of why each was observed during the test. For those investigators eager to develop this test data scientifically and those investigators with the enthusiasm to develop new technical solutions for two-wheel photometry, we encourage you to dive wholeheartedly into this data set. A typical file size for one of these target pixel files is 26 MB. The Kepler Science Center will not support this engineering data with future reprocessings, deliveries or new products. However the Kepler Science Center will support questions through the helpdesk regarding this data set on a best-effort basis. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
