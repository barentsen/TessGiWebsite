Thanks to the many people who submitted Cycle 1 TESS GI proposals, we are very pleased with the response. We are now in the proposal of organizing the review of proposals. 

We received over 140 proposals, about were 60% stellar astrophysics investigations (primarily studies of activity and asteroseismology), a third were focused on exoplanets, and the remaining included extragalactic and solar system investigations.

We anticipate that we will be oversubscribed by a factor of six in large programs, a factor of four in small programs, and a factor of five for 2-min cadence targets.
